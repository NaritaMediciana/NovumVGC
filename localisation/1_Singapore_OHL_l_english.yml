 advisor_SIG_benjamin_jeyaretnam_desc:0 "He was the leader of the Workers' Party from 1971 to 2001. In 1981, he became the first opposition politician since Singapore's independence in 1965 to win a seat in Parliament, when he defeated Pang Kim Hin of the governing People's Action Party (PAP) in a by-election in Anson Single Member Constituency. He was re-elected at the 1984 general election, but lost his seat in Parliament in 1986 following a conviction for falsely accounting the party's funds. His conviction was subsequently overturned by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which called the conviction a "grievous injustice". Jeyaretnam returned to Parliament after the 1997 general election as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP)."

 advisor_SIG_chee_soon_juan_desc:0 "A figure in Singapore's political opposition, Chee has been arrested and jailed several times for his political activities, mainly for making speeches and staging public demonstrations without a police permit. He has also been found guilty of defamation on multiple occasions for comments he has made about members of Singapore's governing People's Action Party (PAP). He was previously barred from standing in parliamentary elections because he was declared bankrupt in 2006 after failing to pay damages from a lawsuit owed to two former Singaporean prime ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong. However, on 24 September 2012, Chee announced that he had raised the sum of S$30,000 needed to pay Lee and Goh. His bankruptcy has since been discharged, which has allowed him to contest the 2015 Singaporean general election. "
