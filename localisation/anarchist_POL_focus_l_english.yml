 POL_anarchist_events.3.d:0 "Many anarchist, from anarcho-capitalists, anarcho-syndycalist, or even anarcho-nationalist, have today hold a metting on whos ideas the anarchy will be under. This is to prevent conflict in our anarchist utopia. Who shall win is decided by votes. The winner is.."

 POL_anarchist_events.4.d:0 "It is clear; anarchism is spreading. They already have control over a large part of central Europe. Today a messenger from the Black army had given us an offer of what they call 'redemption' this is joining the free territory and we will be free as they belive that everyboody can be better. While, many took it as a joke, it seems that it actually isn't. What should we do."

 POL_anarchist_events.5.d:0 "The United States, bastion of capitalism, calling themselves 'land of the free', now has fallen. In this land there were and still are a lot of capitalists who are rich. The unions of united states, will redistribute their wealth properly, and they shall work hard, to show them them how they abused their people. The politics who didn't want anarchy, they will be shown prosperity of it, apologized and admit they were all wrong. Even After all that, there are still some countries that countinue to abuse their workers. They shall be dealt with. All of the world will not be under countries, but under their local unions, and communes."

 POL_anarchist_events.6.d:0 "'I have lived thru the hard days of communism, and later fought with 'democratic' and capitalists opressors. I eventually won! I once thought that I have failed, you know? Many anarchists disagred with me, they were stupid, futurists and some other stupid stuff like Vanguard they didn't have idea if this would work. I build this territory in the image of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwelth, and peace. People here live peacefuly, they have good lives. I need to do a speech on a recent victory of the Black Army over one of the greatest enemies o the anarchist utopia, United States. Goodbye.'"

 POL_anarchist_events.7.d:0 "We might have won the struggle for Poland, but we still do not have a clear leader, leader to lead and represent our perfect capitalist Utopia. Now with our takeover, this needs to change. There were two main candidates on the leadership, Grzesiek Gawin, being one if not the best known anarcho-capitalist in Poland, but he lacks nationalism. The other candidate with much more support in the party is, Marian Kowalski he started from being in Ruch Narodowy to now supporting us. He holds both ideas of capitalism and nationalism, but one the matters of capitalism, he is not as radical as Gawin. The leader is.."

 POL_anarchist_events.9.d:0 "We have lost. While, the communists are no longer in power, the democratic are still a government. Lech Wałęsa had betrayed workers, and created a capitalist society so they are still abused. He also drinks a lot! Today many people that started RSA; Janusz Waluszko, Krzysztof Skiba, Marcin Tryksza, Wojciech Lipka, Marek Skakuj, Maciej Kosycarz, and Tomasz Bójny have met on the terms on restoring the movment back to it's former glory. In the meeting some new people also come in..."
