Conservatives and the right believe that the U.S. military has better strategic capabilities than the Korean military, and that the Korean military led by the U.S. military generals is superior militarily to the Korean military led by the Korean generals. However, liberals and leftists believe that Korea should protect its own country.\n\nAnd National Bolshevists, including the NL, claim that the U.S. control of South Korea's military is undeniable evidence that Korea is the 'colonial' of the U.S. Whatever the facts, the issue of Wartime Operational Control is still a political contention."

Koreans defeated the Syngman Rhee dictatorship with the April Revolution, but then §YPark Chung-hee§! staged a coup in May to establish a new military dictatorship.

But in the first democratic presidential election in decades, Korean democratic activists ran as candidates, dreaming of becoming presidents of each other.

 ##### Leaders #####
 
 POLITICS_KIM_DAE_JUNG_DESC:0 "Since becoming a member of the National Assembly in 1961, Kim Dae-jung has been fighting the military dictatorship for decades and has become a symbol of South Korean democracy. He was threatened with assassination by the military government in 1973, and was arrested and sentenced to death by the military government in 1980. However, due to proper U.S. intervention, he was able to save his life.\n\nWith the collapse of Chun Doo-hwan's fascist military government in 1987 and the start of the first democratic presidential election in decades, he also ran for election. However, the confrontation with other pro-democracy activists in South Korea led to different candidates, which divided the public's votes. so Roh Tae-woo, a colleague of fascist leader Chun Doo-hwan, was elected president despite low approval ratings. He was elected president 10 years later in the 1997 election. It was the first peaceful change of government in South Korean history."
 
 POLITICS_PARK_JIE_WON_DESC:0 "Park Ji-won, a supporter of the far-right military dictator until the 1970s, began a new life as a left-wing democratization activist. Park Ji-won is a former far-right politician in Korea. He challenged politics in the 1980s, supporting Korea's military dictatorship. He supported the massacre of civilians by the Korean dictator at the time and acted according to the far-right ideology.\n\nHowever, one encounter changed the situation. It was a short meeting with Kim Dae-jung, a legendary Korean democratic activist that changed his political ideology. in 1983, Kim Dae-jung met Park jie-won and persuaded him for two hours. He changed Park's mind by talking about democracy and human right, and Park Ji-won shed tears in front of Kim and changed his thoughts to a passionate democratic revolutionary."
 
 POLITICS_LEE_JAE_MYUNG_DESC:0 "Lee Jae-myung is called "Trump of Korea" by opponents, but his life is actually different from Trump. He grew up under his father, a poor gambling addict, and worked as a factory worker as soon as he graduated from grade school. He was exposed to violence while working in a factory in childhood, and has suffered from various types of physical disabilities so far due to the aftereffects of child labor. child labor he experienced as a child has made him fight for the rights of workers and the disabled since he grew up.\n\nHe uses very straightforward speech like Trump and insists on strong reform for his supporters. but, if he becomes president, he will have to decide whether to actually implement what he claims or compromise with reality. Should houses be distributed to all citizens? Should Chaebols Remove?"
 
 POLITICS_LEE_HOI_CHANG_DESC:0 "Lee "Bamboo" Hoi-chang is a judge-turned-politician. While serving as a judge, he gained popularity for his fair judgment, which earned him the nickname "Bamboo Judge," a solid tree. He ran for president in 1997 using his integrity image as a judge, but the Chongpung case hampered him.\n\nThe Chongpung case refers to a case in which politicians who support Lee paid the North Korean government to ask for attack South Korea in order to get South Koreans to vote for right-wing politician Lee Hoi-chang instead of left-wing politician Kim Dae-jung. Through the trial, it was revealed that Lee Hoi-chang had nothing to do with the Chongpung case, but his image of integrity deteriorated."
  
 #POLITICS_CHUN_DOO_HWAN_DESC:0 "Chun Doo-hwan, the dictator who ruled South Korea from 1980 to 1988, is generally considered the last fascist president in South Korean history. However, although he is called a fascist, it is more accurate to say that the nickname fascist has been given to the South Korean public because he has gained hatred from the people by continuing his military dictatorship by slaughtering the citizens who were causing the pro-democracy movement and building the forced-labour camps(Samcheong Gyoyukdae). He was sentenced to death in 1996, but was pardoned and released."
 
 POLITICS_MOON_JAE_IN_DESC:0 "Moon Jae-in's parents lived in the city of Hungnam, very close to North Korea, and when the Korean War broke out, Hungnam city was soon besieged by North Korean army. When the city of Hungnam was besieged by North Korean troops, UN forces fled to South Korea with refugees, including Moon Jae-in's parents, on the freighter SS Meredith Victory just before abandoning the city. therefore he is a descendant of North Korean refugees made Moon Jae-in very interested in the North Korea issue.\n\nHe worked as a lawyer while working in the same office as Roh Moo-hyun, a 20th-century Korean pro-democracy activist. Roh and Moon's friendship lasted several decades, and after Roh became president, he was appointed Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.\n\nUnlike his friend Roh, who did not believe in God, he is Catholic and hostile to homosexuality and other '21 century issues' but after Roh Moo-hyun's death, Roh's best friend Moon Jae-in was recognized by most liberals as the right successor to Roh Moo-hyun's path to Social Liberalism."
 
 POLITICS_PARK_GEUN_HYE_DESC:0 "Park Geun-hye, the daughter of Park Chung-hee, a Korean military dictator in the 1970s, gained high popularity among hard-line conservatives who supported the former military dictatorship. She was elected president of Korea in 2012, but she was evaluated as seriously destroying Korean democracy. At the end of 2016, she was dismissed from the presidency due to the people's revolution called the 'Candle Revolution'."
 
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_TIKHONOV_DESC:0 "Vladimir 'Pak Noja' Tikhnov is a Korean scholar and columnist from the Soviet Union. He gained nationwide recognition among Koreans as his book 'Your Korea,' which strongly criticizes Korea's nationalism, ethnic ideology, and totalitarian culture, became a best-seller in Korea."
 
 POLITICS_AYANE_SAKURA_DESC:0 "Ayane 'Ayaneru' Sakura would not have challenged politics if it were a general situation. However, after the Republic of Japan's anti-Christian fundamentalist revolution, in political turmoil, she took the position of president as a 'symbolic leader'.\n\nShe is just a voice actor with a few acting experiences, but she is gaining high public popularity within the Republic of Japan. Her political power is not great, but the people believe she will teach Japan a new way."
 
 POLITICS_MOON_CHANG_GEUK_DESC:0 "Moon Chang-geuk, a devout Christian and journalist, became the New President amid the collapse of Korean democracy and social turmoil. \n\nMoon Chang-geuk believes that the cause of the problem in Korean society lies in the genetic 'DNA' of Koreans. Koreans are inherently lazy and have genetic problems that can only be lived with help from others. Moon, a devout Christian, thought that the cause of Korea's colonization in the 20th century was that the Christian god ordered Japan to merge Korea to enlighten Korea."

 POLITICS_BAKUFU_DESC:0 "From the beginning, the vain ideal of turning a country where more than 50 percent of the population is atheist into a Christian fundamentalist nation was a mistake. The loose alliance between Christian fundamentalists and post-nationalists cracked as post-nationalists gained strength.\n\nBut not all of Moon Chang-geuk's ideals were wrong. The Republic of Korea must enter the tomb and must not be revived. Now, the new government will elect a new president clean up old Minjok ideology in Korea."
 
 POLITICS_KIM_DAE_JUNG_ND_DESC:0 "Kim Dae-jung, a symbol of the Korean democratic movement, certainly failed once. However, after legalizing Japanese culture, he was once again able to get a chance as the founding father of "Republic of Japan."."

Kim Dae-jung is a legendary pro-democracy activist who has fought against the dictatorships of [KOR.GetName] for decades, and Donggyodng is made up of politicians gathered by his charisma and loyalty to Kim Dae-jung, not political ideology. The most important person in Donggyodong is Park Jie-won. Park Jie-won, a former far-right fascist politician and anti-fascist left-wing politician, is Kim Dae-jung's most valuable partner. He was loyal to [KOR.GetName]'s fascist leader Chun Doo-hwan until the 1980s and prepared to run for the National Assembly. However, Kim Dae-jung met Park Jie-won in person and persuaded him by talking about the value of democracy and the massacre of civilians carried out by the Chun Doo-hwan fascist government. Park Jie-won was deeply moved by Kim Dae-jung's story. He was persuaded to give up his fascist tendencies and turned to the left, and worked as Kim Dae-jung's secretary for about 20 years, fighting for democracy. Park Jie-won, a former fascist, is the successor to Kim Dae-jung recognized by all people. If the NCNP maintains high influence, he will run for president as representative of the Donggyodong faction in the next presidential election.\n\nThe Pro-Roh is a social-liberal faction that is not yet very influential. Pro-Roh gathered around Roh Moo-hyun, a politician who was a former human rights lawyer in [KOR.GetName]. Roh has lost almost every election he has run for himself, and has little influence in the National Assembly. However, he has the image of a reformer as a liberal and is very popular with young people and students.\n\nPro-Lee is a group of socialists supporting Lee "Trump" Jae-myung. He was after graduating from elementary school, he could not enter middle school and had to work in a factory. He is permanently handicapped by his child labor, and has been calling for powerful reforms of the capitalists since becoming a politician. He doesn't use 'diplomatic language' like other politicians, but speaks in a 'worker's language' that is straight forward and mixed with profanity. Lee Jae-myung's language is so aggressive that his opponents call him the 'Donald Trump of Korea'. In real history, Lee Jae-myung had no political influence before the 2010s.
