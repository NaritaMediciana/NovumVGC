 #POLITICS_KIM_DAE_JUNG_DESC:0 "Since becoming a member of the National Assembly in 1961, Kim Dae-jung has been fighting the military dictatorship for decades and has become a symbol of South Korean democracy. He was threatened with assassination by the military government in 1973, and was arrested and sentenced to death by the military government in 1980. However, due to proper U.S. intervention, he was able to save his life.\n\nWith the collapse of Chun Doo-hwan's fascist military government in 1987 and the start of the first democratic presidential election in decades, he also ran for election. However, the confrontation with other pro-democracy activists in South Korea led to different candidates, which divided the public's votes. so Roh Tae-woo, a colleague of fascist leader Chun Doo-hwan, was elected president despite low approval ratings. He was elected president 10 years later in the 1997 election. It was the first peaceful change of government in South Korean history."
 #POLITICS_CHUN_DOO_HWAN_DESC:0 "Chun Doo-hwan, the dictator who ruled South Korea from 1980 to 1988, is generally considered the last fascist president in South Korean history. However, although he is called a fascist, it is more accurate to say that the nickname fascist has been given to the South Korean public because he has gained hatred from the people by continuing his military dictatorship by slaughtering the citizens who were causing the pro-democracy movement and building the forced-labour camps(Samcheong Gyoyukdae). He was sentenced to death in 1996, but was pardoned and released."
 #POLITICS_MOON_JAE_IN_DESC:0 "Moon Jae-in's parents lived in the city of Hungnam, very close to North Korea, and when the Korean War broke out, Hungnam city was soon besieged by North Korean forces. When the city of Hungnam was besieged by North Korean troops, UN forces fled to South Korea with refugees, including Moon Jae-in's parents, on the freighter SS Meredith Victory just before abandoning the city. The fact that he is a descendant of North Korean refugees made Moon Jae-in very interested in the North Korea issue.\n\nHe worked as a lawyer while working in the same office as Roh Moo-hyun, a 20th-century Korean pro-democracy activist. Roh and Moon's friendship lasted several decades, and after Roh became president, he was appointed Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs."
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_TIKHONOV_DESC:0 "Vladimir 'Pak Noja' Tikhnov is a Korean scholar and columnist from the Soviet Union. He gained nationwide recognition among Koreans as his book 'Your Korea,' which strongly criticizes Korea's nationalism, ethnic ideology, and totalitarian culture, became a best-seller in Korea."
