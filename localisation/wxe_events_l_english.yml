Particularly heated debates were held on the issue of attitudes towards Chinese communism."

 russia.1.d:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometers north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

 russia_news.1.t:0 "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d:0 "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his sceptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1:0 "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t:0 "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d:0 "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."

This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."

 russia_news.4.d:0 "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described in a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favored among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."

The third group, consisting mainly of communists of the pre-revolutionary period, agrees in everything with the second group, however, it is not against a temporary alliance with the PRC, as with a fighter against American imperialism.
