 precw.1.t: "Coup`d etat"
 precw.1.d: "Zyuganov, recently elected president of the country, was removed from power yesterday evening. Unknown people in military uniform entered his Kremlin office and politely asked him to leave the office. After a short conversation, Zyuganov simply left, the soldiers did not even have to use force. A few hours later, the new government appeared on TV, announcing "the prevention of communist slavery and a return to the totalitarian past." Vladimir Putin became the head of the new government. Although support for the Communist Party invariably fell in society due to the half-way reformist course of the party, such an anti-constitutional coup caused a wave of protests. People spontaneously gather in the central squares of cities, speaking in support of Zyuganov. However, it seems that even he himself has no control over protests."
 precw.1.a: "Zyuganov removed from power §RPotential Civil War§!"
 precw.1.b: "Protests removed Putin's government and returned Zyuganov to power"
 pprecw.1.t: "Results of our policy"
 pprecw.1.d: "The indecision of the new government and Zyuganov personally in carrying out radical reforms and struggling with Yeltsin`s oligarchy led to the loss of popular confidence and support for the new president`s policy. At the same time, the pro-Yeltsin elements are still strongly opposing the CPRF, no matter what course it will take. The sabotage of the capitalists and the sanctions of the West are hitting the Russian economy very hard, while the starting economic crisis hits most of the Russian people. This of course leads to additional loss of popular support for the CPRF and the president himself."
 pprecw.1.a: "We shouldn't try shocking measures on our society"
 precw.2.t: "Results of the coup"
 precw.2.d: "The protests were unorganised, so they had no effect and were quickly suppressed by the new government. The government announced its provisional character. This time, it is proposed that the fate of Russia will be decided not by the constituent assembly, but by the parliament, in which early elections will be held soon. Situations with economic instability and crisis are getting only worse: foreign investments are leaving Russia, and even Russian oligarchs see no perspective in developing their Russian enterprises and putting money out of the country. In these conditions, the government raises tariffs and taxes on the population. Seems, the entire crisis will be held by the Russian people."
 precw.2.a: "Everybody need to tighten their belts"
 precw.3.t: "Situation changes"
 precw.3.d: "The economic situation in Russia is getting worse, as are the living conditions of the majority of the population. This leads to a wave of crime and spontaneous unorganised protests against the government. Capital is still leaving Russia."
 precw.3.a: "Situation is getting worse"
 precw.4.t: "United Communist Front"
 precw.4.d: "As instability in Russia grows, different communist and some radical left parties in Russia decided to unite in one coalition to organise and lead people's anger against the government. Coalition consists of: RKRP, national bolsheviks, different small left groups and even CPRF takes part in this coalition. On the other hand, reactionary pro-government and far-right elements are also starting to unite across the country as police seems to be able to disobey government in the very critical situation, which can happen in near future."
 precw.4.a: "Situation is getting worse"
precw.8.t: "Meanwhile in fabrics"
 precw.8.d: "Though Russia lost a lot of industry in 1990`s, there are still about 10-15 millions of fabric workers in the country. Their living and working conditions are very bad in comparison with the ones they had in the USSR. With the new crisis they're getting even worse. While there were some events in the 90`s of workers takeover of factories and even workers' militia have sometimes been formed, but nowadays in Russia, with capitalists leaving the country and closing enterprises, acts of workers self-management and takeover of factories are happening across Russia. RKRP has never lost its contacts with workers even after 1992-1993 events, so now they are leading many workers actions and even forming Soviets in some small fabric sites. Government slowly losing power in Russia, while the Soviets are returning to the political stage."
 precw.8.a: "History repeats itself"
 precw.5.t: "Critical moment is getting closer"
 precw.5.d: "People's support for the new communist block rises. Now newly unemployed and wide masses of people with small income groups around the left coalition. However, this coalition seems to be not very united as CPRF talks against Soviets and radical politics of RKRP and nazbols. However, the radical part of the coalition holds a lot of worker congresses and conferences. The most powerful of them for now is the Russian workers committee. Delegates to this meeting are sent from workers collectives from all over Russia, delegates work out united tactics and share workers experience of anti-government actions. This committee is highly influenced by RKRP and now it calls for general strike and congress of Soviets."
 precw.5.a: "History repeats itself"
 precw.6.t: "First all-Russian Congress of Soviets"
 precw.6.d: "General strike has partially collapsed our country. Police cannot even fight criminal elements, right radicals are fighting with communist and workers groups across the country, and the government can hardly be around itself. In this situation communists decided to call for a Congress of Soviets in Petersburg, a heart of revolutionary movement in Russia. In this chaotic situation most delegates will surely arrive in Petersburg and hold the Congress. Perhaps, communists want to repeat bolshevik success and form a new government on the basis of Congress, which will be declared a Supreme power in Russia."
 precw.6.a: "Try to deal with it"
 precw.7.t: "[GetMonth] congress of UCF"
 precw.7.d: "[GetMonth] UCF congress was held, at which the current situation was considered and tasks were set for the near future. The congress was semi-legal. At this congress, M.V. Popov and other prominent figures of the RCWP issued a statement that the time had come to prepare for a socialist revolution. These speeches caused a lot of controversy at the congress. The CPRF split into two factions. The left faction supported the thesis of the RKRP, while the main part of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, together with Zyuganov, opposed it and, having not received the support of the majority of the congress, left it."
 precw.7.a: "Significant milestone of the revolution"
precweasy.7.t: "New October"
 precweasy.7.d: "Police and army groups, which we sent to strike the Congress of Soviets in Petersburg, were demoralised by the people, who crowded around military and police brigades on the way to Obukhov district, where Congress was held. Police and army brigades refused to obey our orders, while squads of right radicals were crushed by armed workers militia, which had been guarding the Congress. Before the Congress began, RKRP together with national bolsheviks had formed the Revolutionary military committee. Communists used workers' militia to capture most important city infrastructure and government buildings. When Congress started, communists announced that from now on all power belongs to the Congress."
 precweasy.7.a: "Mobilise all forces, strike Petersburg!"
 precw.9.t: "New October"
