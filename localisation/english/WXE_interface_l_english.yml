 ################ MECHANICS
 GUIDENAME_Estate_Management:0 "Estate Management"
 GUIDEDESC_Estate_Management:0 "Fourth estates are ideological popularities which shift naturally over time. They represent news media companies or state-funded propaganda outlets. If an ideology loses favor for an extended period, the respective estate will shrink. The opposite is true. These can be altered directly with authoritarian and censorship decisions, or by aberrant events. Aberrant shifts are seemingly random, but the inner machinations are constantly changing.\n\nFifth estates represent local and online political activists acting in support of an ideology not represented by their country’s media. Their influence is much smaller than fourth estates, but they pose different threats and may be elusive."
 GUIDENAME_TLDRESTATES:0 "TL;DR Estates"
 GUIDEDESC_TLDRESTATES:0 "Estates are daily drift for ideology in your nation. There is 5 levels of them and you will start with a certain level of each, potentially 0. Through events you can increase or decrease your estate level which then affects your political drifts. To change ideology you should combat estates that are not the one you are wanting to be."
 GUIDENAME_CapriciousWars:0 "Capricious Wars"
 GUIDEDESC_CapriciousWars:0 "Capricious Wars are created by semi-random events by generating war goals against neighbor countries. Every country has the potential to generate these goals. Certain attributes make it more or less likely, such as ideology and national development. More warlike ideologies will more often get these events whereas developing nations are less likely and developed nations even more so.\n\nDifferent ideologies will also generate different types of war goals. For instance, Fundamentalists and communists are more likely to gain puppet goals whereas fascists and nationalists are more likely to gain conquest goals. Developed democracies will more often flip governments."
 GUIDENAME_GovANDEconomy:0 "Government & Economy"
 GUIDEDESC_GovANDEconomy:0 "The first three descriptors are of the government category. These primarily describe the nation’s administration and advancement. These facets are slow and difficult to change.\nThe second set of three descriptors are of the economy. These are more easily changed and focus solely on the economic state and broad economic policies of the nation."
 GUIDENAME_STATECORE:0 "State Coring"
 GUIDEDESC_STATECORE:0 "To be able to core a state, you must have a positive value of Political Power, be at peace, not currently in a coup, and the state must have 100% compliance. The button will be a white flag in the bottom right of the state screen and will display the Political Power cost for that particular state."
 GUIDENAME_Economy:0 "The Economy"
 GUIDEDESC_Economy:0 "The economy is broken into two parts: health and growth.\n\nEconomic Health is a reserve of all economic growth. It can be expended on certain actions, such as interacting with estates. If it comes within specific thresholds, which may be seen on the five different economic statuses, the economic status of a country will change.\n\nEconomic Growth comes from low taxes or specific policies. It can be reduced by high taxes or other policies. This demonstrates actions that hurt the economy of the country. Growth is calculated every month and moderate taxes will always slowly bring Economic Health to zero."

You must click the option to §Yallow the coup to happen§! (the top option).\nSoon after a series of events will lead to missions/decisions to become available which will require considerable political power, once you complete the §Ygeneral strike§! the civil war will commense. Actions such as deleting units will have no effect."
