He used that time to travel from village to village learning more about his country's culture and traditions. When the reforms began in his nation he was allowed to go back to his university as a part of the Ethics division, and later had a similar position in the ministry of culture. During his time in the ministry of culture he heavily promoted Lithuanian culture, and issued the Jonas Basanavičius Award.

 LIT_events.10.t:0 "Exactly What We Needed..."
 LIT_events.10.d:0 "The new government which took power a few weeks ago needs some stability to show that they are strong and ready to rule Lithuania. In the efforts to end chaos all around the nation, our wise rulers decided to send Mechanised Infantry Brigade Iron Wolf (the core of our army) to secure our control over the nation. This was a horrible idea! The people were able to defeat it and now they are opposed to us even more."
 LIT_events.10.o1:0 "...More chaos, great."
 LIT_events.11.t:0 "A Legitimate Regency"
 LIT_events.11.d:0 "Our nation is in a deep crisis. Many believe that the regency which has many disputes in it, is not strong enough and a strong hand is needed to do so. However, many people believe that different monarchs should rule. They also don't trust us since they think that we will keep power to ourselves, we are corrupt and like Horthy did we will make permanent regency. For a stable and strong Lithuania we will need to make sure that the regency council has a strong legitimacy and people know we will not betray them."
 LIT_events.11.o1:0 "See, we are not so bad after all!"

 LIT_events.12.o1:0 "We shall end communism!"
 LIT_events.12.d:0 "Many communists or radical socialists are descendants of the Communist party of Lithuania. Many, also forgot what they did or thought that at least they would be better then the conservative government which failed and caused mass chaos. The people must remember and never forget about how communists oppressed us."
 LIT_events.13.t:0 "Support From the Radicals"
 LIT_events.13.d:0 "The regency might be kind of trusted by the people, however, our nation has many radicals and chaos is still a large problem. There is one pretty large group that could be convinced to support our cause that is making Lithuania great again; radical nationalists. To the leader of the neo-nazist party we will send an invitation to join the regency council, as he is charismatic and could convince even more to support us."
 LIT_events.13.o1:0 "We can be 'friends'."
 LIT_events.14.t:0 "Making Promises"
 LIT_events.14.d:0 "The Rich of our nation have lost a part of their money, from the crisis that is right now in Lithuania. Their shops, banks, and other places they owned were mostly destroyed, and their profits went down. Now they are annoyed, and even though they are poorer they are still rich which makes them powerful. The heirs of what is going to be the nobility are well... Not as rich as them. Now we shall support them and promise them that the most rich of them, is going to be a part of nobility as well."
 LIT_events.14.o1:0 "There is no reason not to trust us!"

 LIT_events.15.d:0 "Mykolas Burokevičius, was the last secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party. He was pro-Lithuanian independence, he was good to workers, he did some bad things, but they are not that bad. For his involvement in the January Events, he got sentenced to 12 years in prison, because of the all around chaos, he was not able to escape and still is there. Now since we have taken over, it is time to free him from his prison and get him back to our government."

 LIT_events.16.d:0 "Who's the greatest enemy of the workers? Capitalists of course, but once especially in Russia it used to be monarchists. Now we are facing a similar situation to them. Bad, reactionary monarchists are now the greatest dangers to our revolution. The time has come to take them as a serious issue and focus on making sure they are not able to stop us."
 LIT_events.16.o1:0 "No kings here."
 LIT_events.17.t:0 "Supporting Our Workers"
 LIT_events.17.d:0 "Many workers have been hit hard by the current crisis. A large part of them have lost; money , jobs, food, and many other things. This poverty cannot be happening in our communist, workers' utopia! The government (we) have money, workers don't, so why don't give some of that money to our hard working people."
 LIT_events.17.o1:0 "We love workers!"
 LIT_events.18.t:0 "The Rise of Neo-Paganism"
 LIT_events.18.d:0 "Nobody expected what had just happened to happen. Neo-Pagans managed to take over Lithuania. This is not the end hover, the country is still in chaos, most of the nation still hasn't embraced their roots, all of this is a very big problem! If we want stability in our nation, our people need to turn to Romuva, or else!"

 LIT_events.20.d:0 "Antinacinė Lyga (Anti-Nazi League) has today formed. It states that the current president of the Lithuanian republic has done many terrible things such as; cheating in the election, being against Jewish people, and being an all around radical. He agreed with part of these outrageous statements and said he is not going to step down, as many have demanded that he would have done that. Many protests are in the nation, everything is falling apart. We must act fast before our nation falls into a spiral of even more chaos."

 LIT_events.21.d:0 "It seems that Lithuania has been ideologically moving towards us. Now with their situation in a country secured by Neo-nazis. They want to expand their territory. Well, they are a very small country, so they are searching for allies which could help them achieve their dream, and because of them having similar ideology to us, they have decided to ask us if we are interested in an alliance with them."

 LIT_events.22.d:0 "Lithuania wants to take the whole Baltic states region under their control. They have decided not to firstly attack us, but to send us a request for a peaceful annexation of our nation, they say that while our people will have the same rights as Lithuanians if we agree with annexation, however they will have to become Lithuanians, most of our people disagree with this, but if we want to protect our people from the horrors of war. It is time to decide if we should fight for the survival of our nation."

 LIT_events.23.t:0 "Focus of the Five Year Plan"
 LIT_events.23.d:0 "It was decided that in order for a perfect socialist utopia, we will need a strong economy, because of that a new five year plan has been started by us. While we may agree on most things, there are still things such as what the plan should focus on, are up to debate. Some are suggesting that the first thing we should focus on, is the military industry, as we currently don't really have one, and it would give us better protection against the capitalists, others are saying that we should firstly build up the economy, and then that economy would carry the army."
 LIT_events.23.o1:0 "We need to be prepared for a capitalist strike."

 LIT_events.24.d:0 "Even with all our efforts we still see a larger part of our nation being anti-communist. We all agree on the fact that this must be stopped, but we cannot agree how to stop them. The socialists are suggesting rehabilitation, taching the values of socialism to the people who don't agree with it. On the other hand, the more radical communists are saying that the reactionaries are a threat to national stability and must be eliminated at once."
 LIT_events.24.o1:0 "Go with the Socialist's plan."
