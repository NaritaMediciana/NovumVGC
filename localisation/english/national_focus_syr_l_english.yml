syria_news.1.d:0 "President of Syria, Hafez al-Assad has passed away by heart attack while on the telephone with the lebanese prime minister. A state funeral has been held. Foreign Journalists saw Bashar, Bushra and Maher at the funeral and talking to government officials. It is unsure on who was chosen the successor to the syrian presidential seat. Hafez brother Rifaat al-Assad, who has been residing in France after having tried to overthrow his brother in 1984, has expressed his dissapointment and unhappiness over the succession line and claims to be the rightful successor."

 syria.2.t:0 "Death of Hafez al-Assad"
 syria.2.d:0 "By the late 1990s, President Assad's health had deteriorated. American diplomats said Assad had difficulty staying focused and seemed tired during their meetings; he was seen as incapable of functioning for more than two hours a day. His spokesperson ignored the speculation, and Assad's official routine in 1999 was basically unchanged from the previous decade. Assad continued to conduct meetings, traveling abroad occasionally; he visited Moscow in July 1999. Because of his increasing seclusion from state affairs, the government became accustomed to working without his involvement in day-to-day affairs. In June 2000, at the age of 69, Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack while on the telephone with Lebanese prime minister Hoss. The question who will be his successor remains."

It doesnt add to the positives that the mother of Maher, Bushra and Bashar, Anisa al-Assad doesnt approve of Assef as a proper husband.

syria.32.t:0 "Death of Assef"
syria.32.d:0 "Maher, unhappy with how much power was granted to Assef Shawkat, rather then to Bushra's own family, decided enough is enough.
