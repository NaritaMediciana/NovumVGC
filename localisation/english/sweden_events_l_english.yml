 reworked_sweden.3.t:0 "Finland accepts... if we pay"
 reworked_sweden.3.d:0 "The Finnish government has reviewed our request and notified us that such an agreement requires just compensation. Therefore, they want us to pay a large sum or they will not give us Åland back."

 reworked_sweden.4.t:0 "Finland accepts... if we promise peace"

 reworked_sweden.4.o1:0 "A fair offer. We accept."
 reworked_sweden.4.o2:0 "Such a paper has no true meaning. We refuse."
 reworked_sweden.5.t:0 "Finland accepts... if our soldiers stay out"
 reworked_sweden.5.d:0 "The Finnish government has reviewed our request and notified us that such an agreement requires soldiers not interfering with the lives of Åland's civilians. Therefore, they want the island to remain demilitarized under our control or they will not give us Åland back."

 reworked_sweden.5.o2:0 "The island is useless if we cannot station our soldiers there."

 reworked_sweden.8.t:0 "Sweden rejects our compromise"
 reworked_sweden.8.d:0 "While we may have thought our idea of a compromise fair, the Swedish government must have disagreed, because we have been notified that they reject our compromise, and all negotiations for Åland have ceased."

 reworked_sweden.9.t:0 "Sweden invites us to the Nordic Shield"
 reworked_sweden.9.d:0 "Recently the Swedish government created a defensive alliance aimed at forging trust and cooperation among the Nordic countries, and today the government has formally invited us to their alliance, the Nordic Shield. But is it worth joining their alliance?"

 reworked_sweden.12.t:0 "Uniting with Sweden?"
 reworked_sweden.12.d:0 "The Swedish government has sent us a proposal to unite with them in order to recreate the kingdom of Sweden-Norway. Knowing that Sweden has announced its ambitions to become a great power once more, refusing this proposal carries risks of potential conflict."

 reworked_sweden.15.t:0 "Norway refuses"

 reworked_sweden.16.t:0 "Deciding Denmark's obligations"
 reworked_sweden.16.d:0 "Since we intend to vassalize Denmark, we need to decide how much control we directly have over them. Unsurprisingly, if we demand too much of them, they will be more reluctant to submit."

 reworked_sweden.18.t:0 "Sweden demands our vassalization"
 reworked_sweden.18.d:0 "The Swedish government has sent us an ultimatum, threatening war if we do not swear fealty to them. Submitting will sacrifice a lot of our sovereignty, but it is better than what some other vassals in this modern day get."

 reworked_sweden.22.t:0 "Sweden demands Åland"
 reworked_sweden.22.d:0 "The Swedish government has sent us an ultimatum. They demand we transfer Åland to them, or there will be war. Given that their side of the border is heavily fortified, it's safe to say this ultimatum is no bluff."

 reworked_sweden.24.d:0 "While we believed getting Åland back would be as easy as stealing candy from a baby, Finland has boldly decided that war is a preferrable alternative to giving up Åland."
 reworked_sweden.24.o1:0 "Remember that this will cost you your life, Finland."
 reworked_sweden.25.t:0 "Right Wing Retaliates!"
 reworked_sweden.25.d:0 "While we were speaking out against capitalism recently, a vocal minority of right wingers have started protesting against us.

 reworked_sweden.26.t:0 "Working Class Retaliates!"
 reworked_sweden.26.d:0 "There has been no shortage of protests ever since we start speaking out against capitalism, but now it's gotten much worse. The working class is now siding with the right on the economic issues, and protesting against the changes we made for their sake!"
 reworked_sweden.26.o1:0 "The Bourgeoisie brainwashing is too strong!"
 reworked_sweden.27.t:0 "The Army Retaliates!"
 reworked_sweden.27.d:0 "There has been no shortage of protests ever since we start speaking out against capitalism, but now it's gotten much worse. Soldiers are actively leaving the military, and morale is dying out, because the military has sided with the right."

 reworked_sweden.28.t:0 "Socialist Leadership"
 reworked_sweden.28.d:0 "Glory to the revolution! The capitalist order has been overthrown, and the people of Sweden will finally be free of exploitation, equal in all measures, and together in solidarity. However, the ship isn't sailing smoothly just yet. The people must decide on who gets to rule Sweden from now on."
 reworked_sweden.28.o1:0 "Gudrun Schyman is chosen as the new Prime Minister of Sweden"
 reworked_sweden.28.o2:0 "Rolf Hagel is chosen as the new Prime Minister of Sweden"
 reworked_sweden.29.t:0 "The Last Straw"
 reworked_sweden.29.d:0 "'We have known your plans since the start. Your goal is to destroy capitalism and usher in a system where your arrogant asses run the economy, thinking you know anything about running one. We will not stand for this any longer. The red terror dies today!' \nRight wing militias are rising up all across the country against us. Those fools would really rather die than accept change."
 reworked_sweden.29.o1:0 "To Arms!"
