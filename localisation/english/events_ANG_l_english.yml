 angola.1.t:0 "The Death of Jonas Savimbi"
 angola.1.d:0 "Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, is dead. Killed in action fighting Angolan government troops in his home province of Moxico, many questioned the veracity of the reports on his death This is, at the end of the day, the 18th time he's rerported dead. But there was no more questions after pictures of his bloodied and bullet-riddled body appeared on Angolan state television. His designeated succesor, UNITA general António Dembo, was wounded in the same raid that killed him, and died ten days later. Now UNITA leadership falls in the hand of general Paulo Lukamba. \nWithout it's charismatic leader, many are saying that the fight is over for UNITA, and that the best course of action is to bite our pride and make peace with the MPLA government."

 angola.2.d:0 "Jonas Savimbi is dead. Shot 15 times in a skirmish in his home province of Moxico. Now the war is over for UNITA, and they know it, with [ROOT.GetLeader] approaching our government with a cease-fire proposal. \nThere appears to be no reason to deny this proposal, as, without Savimbi, it's unlikely UNITA will run back to bush and resume fighting at the first sign of electoral defeat as they've done previously."
 angola.2.a:0 "Make peace with UNITA"
 angola.2.b:0 "We will accept nothing but full victory"
 angola.3.t:0 "Restore democracy?"
 angola.3.d:0 "Now that the fake MPLA government was finally defeated, questions have emerged about the scheduling of new elections. While [ROOT.GetLeader] and UNITA rule the nation unopposed, many are demanding that democracy be upheld in our new regime, at least to prove to the people that we are different from the MPLA,"
 angola.3.a:0 "Sounds like a good idea"
 angola.3.b:0 "[UNI.GetLeader] will retain control!"
 angola_news.1.t:0 "UNITA Victory in Angola"
 angola_news.1.d:0 "Surprising news from Angola, as UNITA troops loyal to [UNI.GetLeader] have stormed the capital Luanda and cleared out the last pockets of resistance posed by froces loyal to the previous Angolan government. UNITA arose as an independence movment in Angola, fighting the Portuguese colonial forces and later the socialist MPLA government with US and South African aid during the Cold War. Now it's leader [UNI.GetLeader] seats at the presidential chair, and many look at the African nation not knwoing what to expect of this new regime."
