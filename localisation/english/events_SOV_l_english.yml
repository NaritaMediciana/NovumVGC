 election_SOV.1.d:0 "Boris Yeltsin's long-time rule of Russia has recently ended, with his political protegé Vladimir Putin being made acting president. Especially through his resolute policy regarding Chechnya, the previously unknown Putin generally earned the approval of the Russian public. Now, elections for the office of President are being held, and Putin is looking to have his government confirmed.\n\nThe other candidates include the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky, the neo-Soviet communist Zyuganov and the democratic liberal Yavlinsky."

 russia.1.t:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia.1.d:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometres north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."
 russia.1.o1:0 "Horrible!"
 russia.2.t:0 "Russia offers Union State"
 russia.2.d:0 "Our friends in Russia have offered to draw closer in regards to our already pre-existing Union State and to make it a State Union. Sure, it would give up Belarussian independence, but that is but a small price to pay, right?"
 russia.2.o1:0 "The Union it is!"
 russia.2.o2:0 "Resist and bite!"
 russia.3.t:0 "Belarus accepts!"
 russia.3.d:0 "Belarus has accepted the Union State proposal. They will now follow our orders. Our other allies are however unlikely to approve."
 russia.3.o1:0 "Excellent."
 russia.4.t:0 "Belarus resists us!"
 russia.4.d:0 "Belarus has had the audacity to resist Russian wishes for a Union State! We have to prepare an answer."
 russia.4.o1:0 "Fools."
 russia.5.t:0 "Russian Imperialism threatens our Sovereignty!"
 russia.5.d:0 "Russia has united with Belarus, basically rendering the government in Minsk meaningless. This shows without a doubt that Russia is willing to put its own neo-Soviet imperialist demands over the good of its allies! How shall we respond?"
 russia.5.o1:0 "We have to break our ties."
 russia.5.o2:0 "We have to hope for the best..."
 russia.6.t:0 "Russian Southern Protection Program"
 russia.6.d:0 "Russia has announced that it would stand with us in military conflict and has sent us military advisors to help or defend against our adversaries."
 russia.6.o1:0 "Excellent."
 russia.7.t:0 "The Invasion of Crimea"
 russia.7.d:0 "While ethnic Russians always were not the happiest of our population groups, this does not explain the unmarked and heavily armed militias invading the peninsula from the east and pushing out our troops. It is now very clear that these separatists are backed, armed and commanded by the Russians, who are massing on our borders. We have to find a response."
 russia.7.o1:0 "We will back down."
 russia.7.o2:0 "We shall stand and fight!"
 russia.8.t:0 "Ukraine backs down!"
 russia.8.d:0 "The Ukrainian government is forced to retreat! Crimea is ours!"
 russia.8.o1:0 "Excellent."
 russia.9.t:0 "Ukraine meets our challenge!"
 russia.9.d:0 "Against all expectations, Ukraine will fight over Crimea, and in response our commanders have already given the orders to advance. We have started something that we will not be able to stop that easily."
 russia.9.o1:0 "Let's do this."
 russia.10.t:0 "Novorossiya"
 russia.10.d:0 "The eastern provinces of Ukraine rise against us in rebellion! The Russian population groups have called us oppressors and slave herders and have called our friendly relations with the west unacceptable. War is inevitable this time!"
 russia.10.o1:0 "We will send them straight to hell."
 russia_news.1.t:0 "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d:0 "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his sceptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1:0 "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t:0 "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d:0 "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1:0 "Putin's career is at an end."
 russia_news.3.t:0 "Gennady Zyuganov elected President"
 russia_news.3.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1:0 "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t:0 "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d:0 "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described as a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favoured among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."
 russia_news.4.o1:0 "Good luck, Grigory!"
 russia_news.4.o2:0 "...who?"
 russia_news.666.t:0 "Zuganov Claims Victory"

 russia.25.desc:0 "The first part of the founding congress of the Comintern examines the attitude of the Communist International towards fascism. Dmitrov’s wording was taken for the concept of fascism. Some comrades believe that fascism is not a serious threat to Soviet Russia, but can act as a weapon against Western imperialism. Another part of the comrades, led by Mikhail Popov, argues that fascism is the most aggressive imperialism (as Dmitrov’s concept implies) and we need to direct all our efforts to the struggle against international fascism.

The first group of comrades adheres to the positions of a hundred years ago and believes that the Social Democrats are friends of the working class, and therefore to us. The second group of comrades, again led by Popov (but this time also supported by Tulkin), considers Social Democracy a traitor to the working class and believes that it is necessary to fight social democracy in every possible way and oppose its communist ideology.

The first group of comrades considers China a beacon of communism, and the second group considers that there is no communism in China, and considers China a revisionist. The third group, consisting mainly of communists of the pre-revolutionary period, agrees in everything with the second group, however, it is not against a temporary alliance with the PRC, as with a fighter against American imperialism. Sure, spoiling relations with China is not the best option now, but is China worth the betrayal of Marxism? Whose position will the Comintern take?"

Workers, soldiers, working people of Russia, fight to the end and do not feel any regret for your oppressors. In the struggle you will gain your freedom.

And the Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich was born on August 17, 1917 in Finland, in exile with Sovereign Kirill Vladimirovich. He was raised by a truly Russian man. He was fluent in Russian, many European languages, knew the history of Russia, was a well-educated erudite person and felt true pride that belongs to Russia.
