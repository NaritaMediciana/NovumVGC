At 4 AM in Fajr prayer, lots of people were seen attending the prayers in the capital and northern province. Thirty minutes after the prayer was finished, thousands of 'soldiers' stormed major cities, including the capital. At 6:32 AM, as the sun was fully up, new flags were seen being flown in the presidential building, more specifically the Islamic State West Africa Province flag."
