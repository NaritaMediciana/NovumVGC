 ALG_GIA_Insurgency_desc:0 "After the ISF lost the Algerian presidential election in 1992, it allied with other radical islamist groups to fight against the government of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, one of which is the GIA, the Groupe Islamique Armé. This developed eventually into the Algerian Civil War. The government controls more then 95% of the nation again, but remnants of the GIA are causing issues still."
