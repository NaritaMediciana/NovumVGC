With these political events, the current "Cyprus Problem" emerged. In 1983, after Turkey recognised the independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the de facto administration declared by the Turkish Cypriot community, the Republic of Cyprus is referred to as the Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus."

As trust decreases, the threat of a military coup increases. Governments should be careful in this regard."
