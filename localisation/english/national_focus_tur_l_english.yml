Gülen was already under judicial investigation after the release of video tapes in which he allegedly urged his followers who infiltrated the state to lay low and wait for his instructions.\n\nCurrently living in the United States, Gülen will be tried in absentia, which could regardless send a strong enough message to all anti-secular groups within a legal and democratic framework, without offending our conservative-minded citizens.

Unable to submit their candidacies before legal deadlines, Uzan and his comrades have merged themselves with a small party which did, and rechanged its name into the Young Party, or GENÇPARTİ.\n\nThe new party's program hasn't made itself known for clarity, using populist slogans with incredible electoral promises."

Turkish Armed Forces consist of the General Staff, the Land Forces, the Naval Forces and the Air Forces. In 1998, Turkey announced a program of modernisation worth US$160 billion over a twenty-year period in various projects including tanks, fighter jets, helicopters, submarines, warships and assault rifles.  The final goal of Turkey is to produce new-generation indigenous military equipment and to become increasingly self-sufficient in terms of military technologies. According to a study conducted in England, Turkey has the largest deployment of international troops after the United States, with an estimated strength of at least 60,000+ military personnel stationed outside of the borders of Turkey. This means that 1 in 6 of the active military troops of Turkey  are deployed outside of the borders of the country."

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453.\n\nNow the Ottoman Empire has been re-established and declared to be the heir of Byzantium and Sultan Ertugrul is the Kayser-i Rum. The Ottoman Empire needed the Greek state to resurrect Byzantium."

milopinion:0 "The Turkish Armed Forces have intervened in the civilian administration from time to time by stating that internal security is under threat. The main legal basis for these interventions was Article 35 of the Law on Internal Service of the Turkish Armed Forces, which reads as follows: "Article 35 - The Armed Forces must protect and safeguard the Turkish homeland and the Republic of Turkey as defined by the Constitution".\n\nThe military seized power through coups on 27 May 1960 and 12 September 1980 and forced the government to resign on 12 March 1971 and 28 February 1997. \n\nThe event of a threat to the basic building blocks of the Republic, the military's confidence in the government decreases and it issues a memorandum. As trust decreases, the threat of a military coup increases. Governments should be careful in this regard."
