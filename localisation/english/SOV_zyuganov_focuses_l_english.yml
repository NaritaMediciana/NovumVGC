SOV_zug_political_stabilization:0 "Initial Stabilisation"
SOV_zug_political_stabilization_desc:0 "Comrades, Russians! The capitalists of England, America and France are still waging an economic war against Russia. They are taking revenge on Russia for the fact that it once overthrew the power of the landowners and capitalists and thus set an example for all the peoples of the earth. But, this won't happen again. Russia rallied, rose. A little more effort, a few more months of fighting the enemy, and victory will be ours. It was with these words that Zyuganov began his speech, after which pro-left people's squads were self-organised in large cities to maintain law and order in cooperation with the police."
SOV_zug_tax_work:0 "Tax them, but give them Work"
SOV_zug_tax_work_desc:0 "A heavy burden has fallen on the shoulders of the masses since the collapse of the USSR. The growth of high prices heavily reduced the real incomes of the population. It was in the 90s that the ideological and political crisis of society intensified. And hit the institutions of power. Shattered elementary moral standards. It was a society without a future. But WE will stop it! Say "NO" to the exploitative machine! Let's say "YES" to justice! More taxes for the rich! More bread and work for the poor!"
SOV_zug_red_oligarchs:0 "Red Oligarchs"
SOV_zug_red_oligarchs_desc:0 "In order to put into practice our undoubtedly progressive policy, we must use all the methods adopted from the bloody exploiters! "Red oligarchs" as the liberal press calls them will help us with this. Leftist billionaires and entrepreneurs will help us with funds and finances, as well as support communist sentiments abroad, taking on the role of the mouthpiece of the new Russia. In return, using our support and strength!"
SOV_zug_planning_commision:0 "State Planning Commission"
SOV_zug_planning_commision_desc:0 "Restoration of the destroyed industry! Here is our first goal! The revived GosPlan will restore old industrial ties and create new ones!

SOV_zug_statemonopolycapitalism:0 "State-Monopoly Capitalism"
SOV_zug_statemonopolycapitalism_desc:0 "We are building state capitalism, this is the capitalism that we will be able to limit, the limits of which we will be able to establish, this state capitalism is connected with the state, and the state is the workers, this is the advanced part of the workers, this is the vanguard, THIS IS WE. State capitalism is that capitalism which we must place within certain limits, and which we still have not been able to place within these limits. And it depends on us what this state capitalism will be like. For the people? Or for exploiters!?"
SOV_zug_create_state_monopolies:0 "Create State Monopolies"
SOV_zug_create_state_monopolies_desc:0 "State monopoly is an undoubted necessity in our modern world. Millions of people still suffer from malnutrition due to high food prices.

The country needs a state monopoly in strategically important industries immediately."
SOV_zug_public_projects:0 "Public Works"
SOV_zug_public_projects_desc:0 "Weekly subbotniks, what could be more beautiful for getting accustomed to work?

SOV_zug_political_pacification:0 "Political Pacification"
SOV_zug_political_pacification_desc:0 "Our actions have already led to some appeasement of the masses.

SOV_zug_fight_organized_crime_desc:0 "Organised crime has almost become a brand of Russia in the West, "Russian mafia" as it is called, does absolutely everything! Starting from the sale of Soviet weapons to the creation of a whole network of beggars and sprinkles near the metro and churches. There is also information that there are entire drug markets with Afghan "goods" on the border with Kazakhstan and Georgia. It is necessary to immediately give battle to organised crime groups and stop the poisoning of Russians."
SOV_zug_social_security_acts:0 "Improve Social Security"
SOV_zug_social_security_acts_desc:0 "Social protection before this period was just a handout for the working masses, what kind of support can it be if you have to stand in lines in order not to die?! What kind of pension can there be if it is even lower than the minimum wage per month?! We urgently need to allocate money to the social department and amend the laws governing this area of our country! The Party will make every effort to provide truly socialist support to the population! Or Zyuganov is no longer Zyuganov!"
SOV_zug_encourage_population_growth:0 "Encourage Population Growth"
SOV_zug_encourage_population_growth_desc:0 "Great upheavals left scars on the body of Russia, so the initiative group of party members proposed the "Three Step Plan" 1) Establishment of financial assistance to the population through the creation of "Maternity Capital" 2) Creation of federal infrastructure according to the Maternity Hospital-Kindergarten - School-University scheme. 3) Budget subsidies for the full payment of clothing and food for children under 14, and in exceptional cases 18 years."

SOV_zug_china_trade_agreement:0 "Trade Agreement with China"
SOV_zug_china_trade_agreement_desc:0 "Developed trade relations between the Russian Federation and China are a gold mine for both peoples. Since the Russian Federation will be able to sell the products of its industry at fair prices, and China will be able to buy cheap Russian products by increasing the level of consumption. Also, do not forget that the Chinese comrades are also communists and their growing national economy also needs cheap available resources! So let's strengthen our fraternal bonds even stronger?!"

SOV_zug_japan_trade:0 "Japanese technological exchange"
SOV_zug_japan_trad_desce:0 "Despite many diplomatic problems, a number of our enterprises were able to reach out to Japanese industrialists and officials with a proposal for a mutually beneficial technological exchange, so the Japanese expressed their desire to participate in cooperation in the fields of industrial technologies and master the creation of new CNC machine tools.

SOV_zug_novorossya:0 "Ignite Novorossyan uprising"
SOV_zug_novorossya_desc:0 "With the collapse of the USSR, many regions inhabited by Russian people remained outside the territories of Russia. And it so happened that the Russians are the national majority in the eastern regions of Ukraine. But since Zyuganov became the head of the Russian Federation, the situation with Russians in Ukraine has been getting worse every month. It is well known that the Ukrainian oligarchs sponsor special detachments to destroy the communists at their enterprises, however, due to recent events, all Russians have sharply become communists. It no longer surprises anyone that a simple Ivan can be beaten and fired only for a Russian surname. It is necessary to put an end to this, to fan the huge flame of popular uprising from a small spark."
SOV_zug_crimea:0 "Return Crimea to Russia"  
SOV_zug_crimea_desc:0 "The small peninsula of Crimea is a strategically important object, as well as a headache for Ukrainian-Russian relations. Because of the voluntaristic actions of Khrushchev, the peninsula inhabited by Russians and Tatars was completely subordinate to Ukraine. After an unsuccessful attempt to secede from Ukraine in the 90s, numerous pro-Russian separatists remained in Crimea, having contacted them, it would be possible to return Crimea to the Federation without even sending troops. FSB veteran Strelkov is already forming an initiative group of employees to carry out the operation. But what's the plan?"
SOV_zug_agreement_with_china:0 "Alliance with China"  
SOV_zug_agreement_with_china_desc:0 "Our trade policy towards China has yielded stunning results for any forecast.

Many of our citizens are already moving to the Far East for a richer life. And Gennady Andreevich is planning a trip to Beijing to sign a bilateral agreement with China on a military and political alliance, codenamed "Intern". The Chinese delegation will be headed by such an apparatchik as Xi Jinping. Our future comrades depend on this trip."
