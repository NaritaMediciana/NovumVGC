 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Brave New World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the world enters the 21st century, new facets of society begin to form. Political shifts begin as long-existing entities reach further and further from their initial scope. The internet’s ability to broadcast any form of expression to the greater audience of the globe creates new pockets within society. New and old conflicts alike are pursued flagrantly and diligently across vast oceans and insignificant lines in the sand. Perhaps it is inevitable that the earth plunges into chaos, again. Perhaps the chaos itself is fleeting. In this world, only you may decide."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania is a country that unlike others that were under Russian control, didn't have a peaceful change in government. Instead there was a bloody revolution. Currently, Romania is facing many problems such as unemployment. Shall Romania combat its issues, or will their military do it for them?"
 GRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greenland is a large landmass that isn't highly populated. That is not the only trait this island possesses. Large amounts of resources and important positions. Shall they leave their Danish overlords or strengthen their ties with them?"
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a safe and sound spot, being both a member of the EU and NATO. Internal economic downturn and slowdown have however been recently challenging the Danish state."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Conflicts in the middle east, a Russia that could flex its power as it wishes. A China that is getting restless each year... With a global conflict so close, the monarchist continues to discuss a call to historical roots. Roots that move the country into a position of hegemonic power. But how much?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and are about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France, the Grande Nation of old, has tried to find a new spot in an ever-changing world. With old rivals and old friends firmly by her side, with new opponents and new threats on the horizon, France will have to decide if the future of the cradle of democracy shall be unity and peace or a return to more darker times."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Germany is now reunited for almost a decade. Economically stronger than ever, though with the outlook of a recession in the future, Germany needs to find new goals in this world. The freshly independent states of Eastern Europe are in the process of joining the European Union, where Germany holds significant influence. Germany, though troubled by its dark past, looks at a bright future."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the second-biggest economy on earth, has been the powerhouse of East Asian democracies ever since the Second World War ended. Backed by American and European allies and protected by a powerful industrial base, Japan looks at its old rival China with new confidence and new potential for conflict."
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to some point. Norway however still remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China, the backwater of yesterday, is the superpower of tomorrow. Its industrial base great, its political influence growing, its military modernising and its workforce nearly infinite, China has to fear only one thing: If it reforms too slowly, it might be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly, it might destroy itself."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the path back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy were corrupt, the military big but outdated and the political outreach weakened, Russia had to accept to be on the sidelines for a decade. Now, it is looking to get back into the spotlight."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing only little to amend the issues. Sweden, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutral since times immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad in order to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The citizens of the United States have known little but victory in the last century. Winning the World Wars, winning the Cold War; the United States had a nearly perfect track record up until now. But with China emerging on the side of the ocean, with Russia pushing for renewed greatness, with terrorism an ever so great threat, what can America do to stay dominant?"
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey is ever-so unsuspecting."
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Israel is a nation surrounded by countries that would like nothing more than to annihilate it. With few natural resources and only one ally to rely upon, Israel's situation is grim. This may be the only chance for the Jewish people to have a state where they can be guaranteed safety, so what will Israel do? Make peace with their enemies? Or will they take more... forceful path?"
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Turkey ever since it's rebirth has been a mostly peaceful country, regional conflicts in the middle east constantly threaten to spill however the Turks have kept their stability. The Kurds however have been ever increasing their resistance under the PKK, this must be stopped."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Syria has never been a so-called stable country and there are many obstacles to overcome before internal stability can be reached, the Israeli occupation of Golan must be resolved before any such talks can take place."
 PRK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of dictator Kim Il-sung, his son Kim Jong-il took over power. The power succession in the republic created many opponents, and Kim Jong-Il had to massacre many opponents through Simhwajo Purge. The grand purge is complete, and apparently Kim Jong-il's dictatorship is likely to continue forever. However, DPR Korea are two risk left. Hwang Jang-yop, a famous pro-democracy activist who defected to South Korea, and Hyun Yong-chol, a Deng Xiaopingist."
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thailand has a long history however little of it was during a democracy, Thailand must choose how they proceed with caution as the powers of China to the north and India to the West might intend to curtail her power."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 UKR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ukraine is one of the last countries to leave the Soviet Union. Unlike countries like Poland or Baltic countries, Ukraine hasn't fully integrated with the west or didn't like Belarus and went with Russia. It has led to growing unemployment and production has fallen by 50%. Ukraine is on its knees. Will it survive?"
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgarian economy is still recovering from the fall of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. But that is not the only problem that Bulgaria is still facing: weak military, agrarian economy and political crisis. Will Bulgaria recover? Will the Tsardom be restored? Or maybe even technocrats will take power for the second time?"
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Poland has grown massively since its arrival to the European Union in 2004. It is now a regional power and one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. It is on course to become one of the most significant powers in Europe. Poland's current political situation is an interesting one as PiS has gotten into power and relations with the EU have gotten heated. A staunchly anti-Russian country, Poland has made a large effort into strengthening its relations with the United States."
 AZR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Aliyev and Elcibey continue to contend. Will one of the two lead the country or another candidate? What about Karabakh?"
 LAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Latvia had gotten its independence from the Soviet Union, and leaving the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Latvia's economy had taken a hard hit. But that's not the only problem, there is also a problem with Russian minorities and with outdated education systems. Many people in Latvia have started to radicalise, starting parties like Pēdējā partija (last party). Will the crisis continue? Will Latvia stand up and unite the nations of the Baltic? or maybe even communists will take power again."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary got rid of communism in 1989. However Hungary is still recovering from that dictatorship. Many reforms were made and now Hungary is ruled over by Orban who wants to completely destroy the opposition. Many people oppose him, but will they organise and stage a coup to turn Hungary into a dictatorship or will democracy survive?"
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0  "Brazil is a country that has always been on the edge of greatness, it was even once poised to become the next super power. Reforms must be undertaken to put us on a path to become a world leader as our destiny demands of us."
 GRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greenland was once seen as a wasteland with little use. World War Two demonstrated to the world the strategic importance of our island and now we have the chance to exploit resources to make our nation prosper."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The economic situation of Romania in the early 20th century was the envy of the world, now we are but a shadow of its former self. Maybe there will be a way to regain the strength the Romanian people once proudly held."
 BHU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bhutan is a country that is surrounded by India and China, limiting its growth and making them vulnerable to attack and their influence. Currently under India's protection Bhutan faces many issues such as Lhotshampa minority, weak economy, mass illiteracy. Bhutan is right now rapidly transforming, maybe it will turn into a constitutional monarchy, stay as an absolute one, be taken over by its monks, or maybe even there will be a communist revolution in this country?"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Taiwan for the most of the modern day has had a rocky road ahead of it. Parliamentary violence, Chinese meddling, and international denial, Taiwan is a unique case in Asia of both Democracy and Chinese culture. Recently, there have been calls for revenge for 1949, as they were expelled from the mainland. Taiwan's future is in your hands now.\n\n Will the Taiwanese people avenge 1949? Will the course of Taiwan be steered into a new direction, or will the status quo be kept?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 BHU_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Bhutan is a country that is surrounded by India and China, limiting its growth and making them vulnerable to attack and their influence. Currently under India's protection Bhutan faces many issues such as Lhotshampa minority, weak economy, mass illiteracy. Bhutan is right now rapidly transforming, maybe it will turn into a constitutional monarchy, stay as an absolute one, be taken over by its monks, or maybe even there will be a communist revolution in this country?"
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Machine Stops"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Chaos itself is defined primarily by complex starting conditions. Without the proper baseline, a simulation may produce unexpected or detrimental results, as its initial purpose is overshadowed. This date is such a cursed one, of which I warn, upon entering, the experience has left my purview and I cannot guarantee you will find what you’re looking for. Proceed with caution."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignty not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbours grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain national security."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support is dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey is ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into an economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren in Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologising and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
