 algeria.1.t:0 "End of the Algerian Civil War"
 algeria.1.d:0 "The 10 year long GIA insurgency came to an end as the leader of the GIA, Antar Zouabri, was assassinated by the Algerian government. Years of violence now come to an end and Abdelaziz Bouteflika cemented his power again. Islamist resistance groups cause small scale crimes in all of Algeria, but those do not continue the scale of a large war. The GIA continues to exist but is divided on the inside. Abdelaziz Bouteflika offered amnesty to some of the former GIA soldiers."
