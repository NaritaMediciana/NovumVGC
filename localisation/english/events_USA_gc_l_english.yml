 usa.93.d:0 "In order to fully restore the Silver Legion, we must appoint our leader. We could keep Jeff Schoep, the current leader of NSM, in power.

 usa.94.t:0 "The Election of the American Monarch"
 usa.94.d:0 "The time has come to elect the monarch who will rule over this great land. There are six front-running candidates. Children of former presidents are running for monarch, subscribing to the age-old tradition of power through family heritage. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the 35th President of the United States and current Ambassador to Japan, is a popular choice. Barbara Bush, daughter of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush, is also running. Abigail Kawananakoa, the last living descendant of the last queen of Hawaii is running a decent campaign. Paul Emory Washington, a Texas resident and oldest living descendant of the first American President, George Washington, has gained wide support. New York based businessman, Donald Trump, announced his running for monarch, baffling many. He has gained considerable support, as many view him as a symbol of American capitalism and culture. James Mattis, a notable military commander, has gained a great amount of support. Many believe him to be a symbol of America's military might. Who will be crowned? Only time will tell."

 usa.96.d:0 "Now that we have successfully taken control of the nation, it's time we reorganise our party so we can rule efficiently. The most important decision to make is, who will lead us? We could allow Jeff Schoep to keep control over the nation, as he was the leader of the revolution. However, we have some other options. Michael Hill, the leader of the League of the South, contributed greatly to our efforts and is very experienced in our ideals. We also have Matthew Hiembatch, leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, who has had very close ties with NSM in the past."

This political party is radically different from most well-known political parties based in the United States. It aims to place America under the rule of a monarch, whether it be a supreme ruler or a commonwealth between 50 state monarchs. The party is run by an electoral board of advisors who claim that when elected, will organise a national election for the new monarch of America. The winner will then be granted supreme rulership over the nation. Will the US, a country that was established to break from the restraints of the English monarchy, become under the rule of a monarchy once again?"
