  mdeethiopia.2.t:0 "Trading ban for illegal sales of EPO"
  mdeethiopia.2.d:0 "An Ethiopian pharmacy has been banned from trading for three months after a government inquiry confirmed it had illegally sold the blood-boosting drug EPO without a prescription. The Gishen pharmacy in Addis Ababa, located metres away from the national stadium, sold vials of EPO while the national athletics championships were taking place over the road. One pharmacist also admitted to having previously sold EPO to athletes. The inquiry disproved the pharmacy manager’s claim that prescriptions had been sought before the EPO was dispensed to undercover journalists. It found no prescriptions were asked for, nor were any questions asked about why the medicine, a popular performance-enhancing drug for cyclists and athletes, was required."

  mdeethiopia.3.d:0 "Last year, activists leaked the papers for the country’s 12th grade national exams, calling for the postponement of the papers due to a school shutdown in the regional state of Oromia.

  mdeethiopia.5.d:0 "Dozens of homes of squatters who lived in the Koshe landfill site, on the outskirts of the capital, were flattened when the largest pile of rubbish collapsed. Many of the victims were squatters who scavenged for a living in the 30-hectare dump. The Koshe site has for more than 40 years been the main garbage dump for Addis Ababa. According to residents, about 50 houses with about seven people living in each of them were built on the rubbish. Some people blame the collapse on a new biogas plant being constructed on top of the hill. Bulldozers could be seen on top of the hill pushing piles of rubbish around. They said they were levelling ground for the plant, increasing pressure on the hillside and causing the collapse."

The bombing targeted a No. 1233 trolleybus of route 15A, which connects a suburb to Volgograd's downtown area, as it was passing one of the city's markets.

The hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya, and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya.\n\nA security cordon is now established around the school, consisting of the Russian police, Internal Troops and our special unit, the spetsnaz, including the elite Alpha and Vympel units of the Russian Federal Security Service, and the OMON special units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Also a line of three apartment buildings facing the school gym was evacuated and taken over by the special forces and are ready to storm the school.\n\nThe attackers mined the gym and the rest of the building with improvised explosive devices and surrounded it with tripwires. In a further bid to deter rescue attempts, they threatened to kill 50 hostages for every one of their own members killed by the police, and to kill 20 hostages for every gunman injured. They also threatened to blow up the school if government forces attacked. To avoid being overwhelmed by gas attack like their comrades in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis, insurgents smashed the school's windows. The captors also prevent hostages from eating and drinking."

However, when the paramedics approached the school, an explosion was heard from the gymnasium. The hostage-takers then opened fire on them, killing two. The other two took cover behind their vehicle. The second, 'strange-sounding', explosion was heard 22 seconds later. After 2 minutes the fire on the roof of the sports hall started and soon the burning rafters and roofing fell onto the hostages below, many of them injured but still living. Eventually, the entire roof collapsed, turning the room into an inferno. The flames reportedly killed some 160 people. Part of the sports hall wall was demolished by the explosions, allowing some hostages to escape. Local militia opened fire, and the militants returned fire. A number of people were killed in the crossfire. Once the shooting started, troops had no choice but to storm the building. A chaotic battle broke out as the special forces fought to enter the school. The forces included the assault groups of the FSB and the associated troops of the Russian Army and the Russian Interior Ministry, supported by a number of T-72 tanks, BTR-80 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and armed helicopters, including at least one Mi-24 attack helicopter. Many local civilians also joined in the chaotic battle. At the same time, regular conscripted soldiers reportedly fled the scene as the fighting began. Civilian witnesses claimed that the local police also had panicked, even firing in the wrong direction. Sporadic explosions and gunfire continued at night despite reports that all resistance by militants had been suppressed, until some 12 hours after the first explosions.
