 turkey.1.t:0 "The July 15th Coup"
 turkey.1.d:0 "On July 15th, 2016, several circles within the Turkish military had grown fed up with the increasingly jingoistic and islamistic policies of the [TUR.GetLeader] administration.\nIn several large cities, including Istanbul and Ankara, insurgent troops tried to take over government buildings and central infrastructure like bridges during the night.\n\nQuickly after, pro-government civilians swarmed the streets to protest the coup attempt, eventually overpowering the insurgency and practically forcing the government back to power. [TUR.GetLeader], on vacation at the time, called upon his supporters to resist via social media and had informed them that he evaded capture.\n\nTurkey's government is still in power, but there will need to be serious repercussions - but the opposition warns the ruling [TUR.GetRulingParty] to not abuse their influence in this position of power. However, there will need to be some sort of vengeance for the more than 300 killed during the battles in the night.\n\n[TUR.GetLeader] has already found the culprit though - he has repeatedly pointed to exiled islamic preacher Fetullah Gülen, living abroad in the United States. Is his movement really to blame? Doubts and wild theories are running rampant throughout the entire country and among all political forces."
 turkey.1.o1:0 "We will make them suffer for this."
 turkey.2.t:0 "Response to the Coup"
 turkey.2.d:0 "[TUR.GetLeader] has safely returned to power and his [TUR.GetRulingParty] is firmly back in power. Now, a joint political counter offensive against the former insurgents, coordinated by all branches of the Turkish government, is ready to be launched."
 turkey.2.o1:0 "Let's blame this on Gülen and be done with it."
 turkey.2.o2:0 "We need to heal the nation. Let's investigate first."
 turkey.3.t:0 "The Investigation brings up nothing"
 turkey.3.d:0 "As it turns out, the military insurgency was nothing but a military insurgency - generals behind the scenes, willing to take power at the expense of the government. Many inside the ruling [TUR.GetRulingParty] had had wild conspiracy theories - but they seem to all have been wrong."
 turkey.3.o1:0 "Damn military despots."
 turkey.4.t:0 "The Investigation points to Gülen!"
 turkey.4.d:0 "Our conservative politicians were right after all! Several transcripts and eMails point to Fetullah Gülen as directly responsible for instigating the coup in order to regain power in Turkey and to depose [TUR.GetLeader] and, as it is stated in one eMail, 'have him executed'."
 turkey.4.o1:0 "We knew it!"
 turkey.5.t:0 "The Investigation points to the Kurds!"
 turkey.5.d:0 "While our initial theories regarding Gülen were wrong, there IS a conspiracy going on. It seems that Kurdish politicians and local militia commanders financed and prepared the coup, but failed to execute their planned blitz attacks in Turkish Kurdistan."
 turkey.5.o1:0 "Damn bastards!"
 turkey.6.t:0 "The Investigation points to Communism!"
 turkey.6.d:0 "Neither Gülen nor the Kurds seem to have much to do with the coup on July 15th - but our communist and far left political insurgents have.\n\nThis is an unexpected enemy to face, but we will face these red bastards anyway!"
 turkey.6.o1:0 "Better red than that other red!"

  turkey.12.t1:0 "Operation 'Back To Life'"
  turkey.12.d1:0 "Determined to end radical leftist groups' hunger strikes, the military has launched a coordinated operation in twenty prisons at once, aiming at transferring the unruly inmates to the supermax facilities. The raids faced stiff opposition from convicts in many facilities, who set up makeshift barricades to keep soldiers from accessing their wards. Sheer force was used in such cases, leading to blown up walls and fires suffocating countless inmates. At least 30 prisoners are estimated to have been killed, along with two soldiers in murky circumstances.\n\nWith a media blackout on supermax facilities in full effect, the National Police has launched a vast crackdown against all dissidents and left-wing groups who had supported the hunger strikers. The hunger strikes have not stopped in the new prisons, the wardens of which have already been accused of leaving the strikers to die, isolated from their comrades. For what it's worth, European Union officials have condemned Turkey's management of the crisis."
  turkey.12.o1:0 "So much for 'Back to Life'."
   turkey.13.t1:0 "Media Mogul Enters Politics Before Election"
  turkey.13.d1:0 "The Uzan Group is one of the most powerful conglomerates in Turkey, if not currently the most influential. A family business, it controls Star Media, including Turkey's first private television channel and its most widely-read newspaper, as well as two banking institutions, a mobile operator and several radio channels.\n\nThe elder son of the family, Cem Uzan, has decided to use this massive source of public influence and invest it into his own political career just as Parliament announced early election. Unable to submit their candidacies before legal deadlines, Uzan and his comrades have merged themselves with a small party which did, and rechanged its name into the Young Party, or GENÇPARTİ.\n\nThe new party's programme hasn't made itself known for clarity, using populist slogans with incredible electoral promises."

Quickly taken to the Başkent University Hospital in Ankara and treated within the next 26 hours of an 'intestinal infection', doctors have ordered Ecevit to stay home as much as possible and come to regular treatments in the hospital, severely diminishing his capacity to tend to the country's busy schedule.
