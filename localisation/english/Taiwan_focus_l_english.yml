 risk_of_war:0 "§RThis has a medium chance of leading to war with the PRC. Be careful.§!"
 The_Anti_Beijing_League:0 "The Anti-Beijing League"
 china_army_xp:0 "Legacy of the civil war"
 china_army_xp_desc:0 "Ever since our defeat in the civil war, we have been stuck on this island. We must improve our own army by learning from our mistakes we made."
 china_mixed_army:0 "Balanced Approach"
 china_mixed_army_desc:0 "It is ridiculous to think that we will ever retake the mainland if our army only consists of meat shields or gun-equipped tractors. Whatever we do to reform our army, it should put balance above everything else."
 china_infantry_army:0 "Infantry-based Approach"
 china_infantry_army_desc:0 "Tanks are of course great, but it's the men that win our wars. We have a small manpower pool compared to the PRC, so we should look to expand it and catch up. Once we're caught up, we will be unstoppable!"
 china_rifle_research:0 "Rifle Modernization"
 china_rifle_research_desc:0 "There is no shame in admitting that our rifle designs are mediocre at best. The time has come for us to make a new rifle design that will earn us victory in the future, and we'll start by importing new tooling and producing up-to-date rifles."
 china_artillery_research:0 "Reverse Engineer American Artillery"
 china_artillery_research_desc:0 "Artillery is immensely useful for our army, but just like with our rifles, our artillery needs to be modernised. If we can reverse engineer the newest American design, we'll surely know what is the optimal way to construct artillery."
 china_tank_army:0 "Armour-based Approach"
 china_tank_army_desc:0 "We live in an era where bravery and guns alone will only get us annexed by the PRC. The future will be won with the supreme firepower of tanks, and since we should look to improve our strategies with an armoured focus in mind."
 china_tank_research:0 "Armour Trials"
 china_tank_research_desc:0 "We didn't embrace the power of armour enough during the civil war, but if we hold trials for new armour designs, we have the chance to develop highly advanced tank designs."
 china_support_equipment_research:0 "Support Equipment Research"
 china_support_equipment_research_desc:0 "Just like a dog is a man's best friend, support equipment is a soldier's best friend. Modernising our shovels, tents and auxiliary equipment will make us much more self-sufficient."
 china_manpower:0 "Conscript a new Generation"
 china_manpower_desc:0 "We haven't fought anyone since the civil war, which was a long time ago. With less people being interested in retaking the mainland, our supply of soldiers is depleting. Our fastest way to fix that is to enact conscription."
 china_planning_bonus:0 "Improve the Army's Coordination"
 china_planning_bonus_desc:0 "When you have a large army, you inevitably run into the problem of soldiers not being coordinated. This is fortunately not something insoluble, as we can solve this by training our soldiers to cooperate."
 china_morale_bonus:0 "Improve our Morale"
 china_morale_bonus_desc:0 "A way to have our soldiers more organised and ready to fight is to treat them well with medical equipment out of combat. And if they can get organised faster, we will be less likely to lose ground to the PRC."
 china_production:0 "Production Quotas"
 china_production_desc:0 "If we are to use armour to retake the mainland, we will need a lot of it. Unfortunately we don't have much to work with for now. While definitely painful for our fellow workers, we can give them quotas to build a certain amount of tanks every month, which in the best case scenario will make them produce them in massive amounts."
 china_trucks:0 "Teach Motorised Combat"
 china_trucks_desc:0 "A tank division cannot fight if it's entirely made up of tanks. Support from truck and mech drivers is crucial, so we should train our soldiers to fight in trucks to support the tanks."
 china_logistic_training:0 "Improve our Logistics"
 china_logistic_training_desc:0 "Large armoured armies will of course need a lot of supplies to fight effectively, but we can train our soldiers to use less supplies, which will highly benefit us in the long run."
 china_speed_priority:0 "The Art of Speed"
 china_speed_priority_desc:0 "Back in the early 1940's, Germany was able to get an upper hand in the Second World War by outspeeding its opponents. We should follow this strategy while making sure we don't repeat the mistakes the Germans made."
 china_defence_priority:0 "Defensive Champions"
 china_defence_priority_desc:0 "Despite having been exiled to Taiwan, we never lost the precious island to the communists. We will show the world that no matter how hard you beat us, we will never surrender, nor will we ever lose."
 china_offence_priority:0 "Shattering the Defences"
 china_offence_priority_desc:0 "Once a battle starts, we have one goal, and that goal is to win. We must fiercely fight until we either win or cannot continue, and given our reforms, this mindset can make us truly unstoppable."
 china_navair_xp:0 "Commanding the Navy and Airforce"
 china_navair_xp_desc:0 "It is true that our foot-soldiers are what will retake the mainland, but we cannot afford to neglect our navy or the airforce, especially since the former is necessary for our troops to land in the mainland. We must also have control over the skies if we don't want our soldiers bombed into oblivion."
 china_build_dockyards:0 "New Naval Facilities"
 china_build_dockyards_desc:0 "It is time we construct new dockyards on our coasts. With these dockyards we'll be able to construct new ships to help us land on the Mainland."
 china_better_dockyards:0 "Workers for the Dockyards"
 china_better_dockyards_desc:0 "Even though we have dockyards, we don't have enough people working in them. Luckily this can be fixed by forcing the unemployed to work in them. This will also give us far more ships every year."
 china_capital_navy:0 "Battleship Plan"
 china_capital_navy_desc:0 "The Battleship Plan is simple. We make a strong capital navy that consists of battleships, frigates and a few carriers that will overpower even the largest navies."
 china_submarine_navy:0 "Submarine Plan"
 china_submarine_navy_desc:0 "The Submarine Plan isn't complicated. The plan is to make a lot of submarines that will be more useful for harassing enemies than outright sinking them. Corvettes and Frigates shall also be built in case we need to sink enemy ships."
 china_corvette_research:0 "New Light Ships"
 china_corvette_research_desc:0 "As stated before, light ships are useful support vessels, regardless of whether we use capital ships or submarines. We shall construct new corvette designs to support our navy."
 china_frigate_research:0 "Frigate Patrols"
 china_frigate_research_desc:0 "Similarly to corvettes, frigates are vessels that will be good for supporting our navy. However these are much stronger than corvettes and will be more self-sufficient in combat."
 china_submarine_research:0 "Pack of Death"
 china_submarine_research_desc:0 "While the plan was to originally harass enemies, that doesn't mean we cannot sink our enemy's convoys. In fact, it's a great idea when sailing in the hostile seas of East Asia."
 china_marine_research:0 "Train the Marines"
 china_marine_research_desc:0 "If we want to successfully invade our enemies without a large navy, we will need well trained and loyal marines. Once they're properly trained and well equipped, they will turn any enemy beach into a graveyard."
 china_missile_cruiser_research:0 "A Chinese Kraken"
 china_missile_cruiser_research_desc:0 "The legendary Scandinavian sea monster known as the Kraken struck fear into any sailor unfortunate to get stuck in the North Sea. We will strike fear into our enemies with our advanced missile cruisers just like the Kraken did."
 china_carrier_research:0 "Carrier Mastery"
 china_carrier_research_desc:0 "A powerful ship is already pretty scary, but supported by a carrier's planes it becomes even scarier. We should produce many carrier ship hulls and make our foes so scared they wet their pants!"
 china_sturdy_ships:0 "Prioritise Ship Defence"
 china_sturdy_ships_desc:0 "If our fleets are sunk by the enemy, all hope of retaking the mainland will be lost. We need to make our ships sturdy to make sure that even if things go south, the hope doesn't die."
 china_hard_hitting_ships:0 "Prioritise Ship Offence"
 china_hard_hitting_ships_desc:0 "If our fleets are unable to sink the enemy or at least make them retreat, our troops won't over the hostile East Asian waters safely to retake the mainland. Because of this, we must design our ships' guns with firepower in mind."
 china_build_anti_air:0 "Taiwanese Air Defence"
 china_build_anti_air_desc:0 "It should be a priority to not let our enemies bomb us back into the stone-age, and since we have more than enough airports for an airforce, what we should build are static anti-air guns."
 china_air_doctrine:0 "Training for Aerial Battles"
 china_air_doctrine_desc:0 "We have planes, we have men, but we don't have professionals in our airforce. Fortunately we can hire experts to train our pilots for the battles in the skies."
 china_fighter_research:0 "Design our own Fighters"
 china_fighter_research_desc:0 "While we have a number of fighters, our current number of fighters is too low to beat super powers in an air war, so to compensate for that weakness we should get a hold of far more advanced fighters that will effortlessly beat the fighters of our enemies."
 china_nuclear_research:0 "Taiwanese Wonder Weapons"
 china_nuclear_research_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons are dangerous, and definitely not toys to recklessly play with. However we can scare our enemies by having them know that we have the power to destroy everything the very second we drop a nuclear bomb, so we should research nuclear technology."
 china_stability:0 "The East's shining Democracy"
 china_stability_desc:0 "As the 21st century begins, we remain humiliated by the fact our rightful lands are still held by the despicable dictators in Beijing. However, this is the century where we can change that. We are the shining democracy in Asia, and we will bring glory to Taiwan."
 china_military_coup:0 "Power to the Military"
 china_military_coup_desc:0 "Too many people in the government simply do not care about fixing the wrongs of the past. It is only the militarist faction of the Kuomintang that will revive the old China, and for that to happen, a short and hopefully bloodless coup shall be staged."
 china_destroy_democrats:0 "Purge Democracy"
 china_destroy_democrats_desc:0 "We have taken over the country, yet people refuse to obey our commands. No matter what we did, the democrats have been undermining us constantly. There is only one solution left. We will strike down the democratic parties and establish our direct rule over Taiwan."
 china_restore_order:0 "Problems Eradicated"
 china_restore_order_desc:0 "With our political opponents purged and us having eradicated all internal problems, we are able to restore order and emerge stronger than before."
 china_keep_military_dictatorship:0 "Assert Militarist Dominance"
 china_keep_military_dictatorship_desc:0 "It would be unwise to change our government now. We may be in a bit of a messy situation, but we are recovering and wasting time on more government reforms might be better used to prepare to strike the mainland."
 china_become_monarchy:0 "The Monarchist Opportunity"
 china_become_monarchy_desc:0 "With the still somewhat unstable situation in Taiwan, we can make our move to ditch the military dictatorship, and reestablish the monarchy."
 china_anti_prc_alliance:0 "The Anti-Beijing League"
 china_anti_prc_alliance_desc:0 "We aren't the only countries in Asia that are hostile towards the PRC. We should make an alliance against the PRC and invite worthy Asian allies who will help us accomplish our goal."
 china_invade_indochina:0 "Conquer Indochina"
 china_invade_indochina_desc:0 "The Indochinese countries of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are all strategically important for us as we can use them to invade the PRC from the south. However it is unlikely we can ally with any of them, so we must resort to violence, and we will conquer all three countries."
 china_invade_thailand:0 "The Threat in Thailand"
 china_invade_thailand_desc:0 "Thailand isn't as important as the Indochinese countries because it doesn't border the PRC, but it gives us more space to get into Myanmar which might be a useful ally. Since Thailand is likely not going to cooperate with us though, we'll just get to Myanmar by force."
 china_invade_myanmar:0 "Strike at Myanmar"
 china_invade_myanmar_desc:0 "Myanmar is a potentially very useful ally against the PRC, even more so than Thailand and maybe even Vietnam and Laos. But Burmans aren't exactly our friends, and we cannot afford to get backstabbed by them, so we'll just invade them."
 china_ally_indochina:0 "Negotiations in Indochina"
 china_ally_indochina_desc:0 "Going to war with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam is not a very intelligent move, as the people there will undoubtedly hate our overlordship. With that in mind it will be much simpler to have the three countries ally with us. If they don't want to, that's just too bad."
 china_ally_thailand:0 "Befriend the Bangkok government"
 china_ally_thailand_desc:0 "Thailand is a country that we should be able to get on our side for a war against the PRC. As long as they don't sympathise with the communists, they will most likely stay loyal to us."
 china_ally_myanmar:0 "Deal with Myanmar"
 china_ally_myanmar_desc:0 "Myanmar is not a country everyone would want as an ally at first, but in our situation we can definitely use their help as their military is large and we can use them as another way to get into the PRC. We should try to ally with them."
 china_keep_democracy:0 "Strengthen Democratic Elements"
 china_keep_democracy_desc:0 "We are already a democracy, but it's time we expand our democracy outside of just Taiwan. Like the US, we will be the bastion of democracy, but our focus is on East Asia."
 china_desire_to_return:0 "Promote Patriots"
 china_desire_to_return_desc:0 "Even though some people have lost interest in retaking the mainland, it'd be false to claim that no one wants to get revenge on the communists. We need support from the people to achieve this desire, and one way to get more people to support our cause is to promote patriotism."
 china_spread_democracy_in_prc:0 "Diplomatic Assault"
 china_spread_democracy_in_prc_desc:0 "Our intel suggests that stability in the PRC is low, which is perfect for us. We can diplomatically speaking attack the PRC by sending anti-communist agents to the mainland and spreading democracy there."
 china_support_democratic_left:0 "Support Taiwanese Leftists"
 china_support_democratic_left_desc:0 "The leftist parties of Taiwan are defined as wanting more of a Taiwanese identity, as well as more welfare and being overall pretty progressive. Fortunately for us, they are not opposed to retaking the mainland, so we should support them with some funding and make Taiwan a left-wing democracy."
 china_support_democratic_right:0 "Support Taiwanese Rightists"
 china_support_democratic_right_desc:0 "The Rightist parties of Taiwan are defined as wanting to keep the Chinese identity over a Taiwanese identity, as well as freer markets and more traditional values. Since they are far more willing to retake the mainland for our democratic ideals, we should fund them for a right-wing Taiwan."
 china_support_seperatists:0 "Fuel Uyghur Separatism"
 china_support_seperatists_desc:0 "In the Xinjiang province there is an ethnic group known as the Uyghurs, and the treatment of them by the PRC has not been great to say the least. Because of this, we should support their wishes for a free East Turkestan, because even if it sabotages us, it will in the long run sabotage the PRC more."
 china_treat_minorities_well:0 "Society of many Races"
 china_treat_minorities_well_desc:0 "Sun Yat-Sen believed in equality for all races in China, which we know thanks to the Five Races Banner. With that in mind, we should teach our future generations that mistreating minorities is not right."
 china_treat_minorities_badly:0 "Han Chinese Dominance"
 china_treat_minorities_badly_desc:0 "Sun Yat-Sen may have believed in equality for the Chinese races, but it doesn't mean we need to necessarily treat the non-Chinese minorities well. We'll treat the minorities of Taiwan however we please, especially if it helps us build a future where the Han Chinese dominate all of China and Taiwan."
 china_minorities_are_equals:0 "Multicultural Identity"
 china_minorities_are_equals_desc:0 "Now that we have fixed the problem with people discriminating against others based on race, we can destroy the root of the disease, which is intolerance of foreign cultures. Such xenophobia is not acceptable, and we should make a law that will prevent our people from doing such acts."
 china_remove_minorities:0 "Create an Ethnostate"
 china_remove_minorities_desc:0 "History has taught us that multicultural societies always end up badly, like Austria-Hungary and Yugoslavia. Our only way to prevent us from sharing their grim fate is to displace all minorities from our lands!"
 china_nationalist_bastion:0 "Nationalist Bastion"
 china_nationalist_bastion_desc:0 "Despite our distance from Nanjing and our lack of recognition, we are more than merely a rebellious province. We have a strong economy, advanced education, a patriotic society and more human rights than the PRC will ever have. We have a country that can truly call itself 'The Bastion of Nationalism'."
 china_subsidies_for_construction:0 "Construction Subsidies"
 china_subsidies_for_construction_desc:0 "After some thorough analysing, it has been deemed necessary that we give subsidies to construction companies in order to improve our economy even more, as well as catch up with the PRC."
 china_increase_welfare_benefits:0 "Emergency Welfare"
 china_increase_welfare_benefits_desc:0 "As our economy grows, we have more money that we need to spend on our citizens. Thanks to our population being hard-working, giving them welfare will not backfire with them becoming lazy slouches. We should also financially assist the people in urgent times."
 china_avenge_Chiang:0 "Avenge Chiang Kai-Shek"
 china_avenge_Chiang_desc:0 "The PRC has miraculously lasted for decades, but every single day that passes is a day where the dictatorship outlives its usefulness. It is time that our people overthrow the emperors in Beijing just like we did in 1911, and we will save the Chinese people for good."
 china_unite_china:0 "Rebirth of the Republic of China"
 china_unite_china_desc:0 "We have beaten the PRC, but as long as other states in China exist, it can never be united. We will start a unification campaign, in which we will take down every single warlord who claims to own soil."
 china_integrate_our_lands:0 "Secure our lands"
 china_integrate_our_lands_desc:0 "China is finally united under our banner, for the first time since the 1940's. We may still have work to do and rebuild the lands, we have avenged the ideals of Sun Yat-Sen. Long live the people of China, for they have united it!"
 china_uprising_in_tibet:0 "Incite Rebellion in Tibet"
 china_uprising_in_tibet_desc:0 "The Tibetans have let us know that they are willing to assist us in the war against the PRC. Once they revolt, we will have an easier time beating the PRC while they're forced to send troops to suppress Tibet."
 china_uprising_in_xinjiang:0 "Start the Uprising in Xinjiang"
 china_uprising_in_xinjiang_desc:0 "Our intelligence services have kept in contact with those who wish for independence for Xinjiang, or East Turkestan as they call it. Now that we're fighting the PRC, we will have them stage a revolt against the PRC, even if it means we don't get to have Xinjiang for ourselves."
 china_uprising_in_manchuria:0 "Cause a Revolt in Manchuria"
 china_uprising_in_manchuria_desc:0 "Manchus have never been treated well by the Han Chinese, and they won't be once we retake Manchuria, but fortunately for us they are willing to help us fight the PRC and rebel, which at the cost of us losing our guarantee of getting Manchuria will serve as a great distraction."
 china_uprising_in_Guangxi:0 "Republicans of Guangxi"
 china_uprising_in_Guangxi_desc:0 "Our invasion of the PRC hasn't been successful enough so far. We shall contact the people of Guangxi to come and fight the PRC on our side, but since they will get their own state it will be unlikely they will willingly rejoin us after the war is over."
 china_uprising_in_Yunnan:0 "Republicans of Yunnan"
 china_uprising_in_Yunnan_desc:0 "Our invasion of the PRC hasn't been successful enough so far. We shall contact the people of Yunnan to come and fight the PRC on our side, but since they will get their own state it will be unlikely they will willingly rejoin us after the war is over."
 china_uprising_in_Shanxi:0 "Destabilise Control over Shanxi"
 china_uprising_in_Shanxi_desc:0 "We can entice the people in Shanxi to join our cause against communism. However this will mean splitting up the lands we will own once the war is over. We should choose wisely."
 china_uprising_in_Qinghai:0 "Destabilise Control over Qinghai"
 china_uprising_in_Qinghai_desc:0 "We can entice the people in Shanxi to join our cause against communism. However this will mean splitting up the lands we will own once the war is over. We should choose wisely."
 china_constitutional_monarchy:0 "A Monarchy with a Constitution"
 china_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "Our emperor has embraced the idea of making Taiwan a constitutional monarchy. This kingdom will not survive if we try to control every aspect of our people's lives like a totalitarian dictatorship. Our emperor will modernise his new kingdom and adapt to democratic principles without losing the monarchist spirit."
 china_attract_scientists:0 "Attract Democratic Intellectuals"
 china_attract_scientists_desc:0 "While we need to bring back stability to our kingdom, we must not forget what every nation in the modern age needs, intellectuals and researchers. With this in mind, it's in our best interest to make Taiwan a welcoming place for intellectuals, even if they oppose our monarchy. We shall further increase our education budget so we can raise a generation of intellectuals."
 china_allow_elections:0 "Democracy in the Kingdom"
 china_allow_elections_desc:0 "We still feel pressure from the unrest. The people want the ability to choose their leaders, and we shall partially grant them that wish. We will make it law that our emperor does not infringe on the right to vote. This will please our people and show them that ultimately we serve them."
 china_befriend_uk:0 "Befriend the United Kingdom"
 china_befriend_uk_desc:0 "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a constitutional monarchy just like us. They also have a powerful military force and would be a valuable ally for us. We should befriend the UK and show them that we are following their ideals. In the future this will likely make them want to ally with us."
 china_ally_uk:0 "Join the British Alliance"
 china_ally_uk_desc:0 "The United Kingdom has formed a faction with it as its leader. It is obvious that we should try to ally with them by applying to join their faction. However it is not guaranteed that they will let us in given that if they ally with us it will sever their ties with the PRC."
 china_absolute_monarchy:0 "A Monarchy with Absolutism"
 china_absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "Our emperor has embraced the idea of making Taiwan an absolute monarchy. Only through strict order and principles can our empire survive, for without it we will get crushed like the Qing Empire did. Our empire will follow tradition and martial prowess."
 china_silence_critics:0 "Expel the Critics"
 china_silence_critics_desc:0 "Foreign devils and disloyal scum plague our island, and they exploit our people with their lies. We will violently silence all critics in order to prevent a catastrophe caused by the masses falling victims to the lying media."
 china_warrior_monarchy:0 "The Warrior Code"
 china_warrior_monarchy_desc:0 "We want our monarchy to be a militarily powerful superpower, but for now we are nearly a rump state due to the state of our society. We will raise a new generation of warriors by making our principles built on a warrior code."
 china_kings_cult:0 "Vile and Corrupt Snakes"
 china_kings_cult_desc:0 "Many monarchies throughout history were rampant with corruption, and only survived because no other political system could beat it in the old days. Now, corruption will badly poison any monarchy, and action must be taken to limit corruption as well as make sure everyone in our government is most loyal to our emperor."
 china_pseudo_isolationism:0 "Stay within China"
 china_pseudo_isolationism_desc:0 "We do not wish to cause global turmoil. Our only goal is to secure a Chinese monarchy. A war abroad will only waste our resources, and instead we should keep our island away from conflicts outside of Asia."
 china_new_imperialism:0 "Embrace Imperialism"
 china_new_imperialism_desc:0 "If we are to assert ourselves as an empire, we must be ready to strike anyone who we need to invade. It is not acceptable to stall when we have one billion people to liberate."
 china_subjugate_sea:0 "Southeast Asian Tributaries"
 china_subjugate_sea_desc:0 "Every empire needs some subjects, and we will need some for ourselves to show off our dominance. Fortunately for us, the South East Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar are all countries that would make for valuable subjects. We will send them ultimatums, demanding that they submit to us. If they don't, we'll destroy all of them."
 china_ally_japan:0 "The Rising Sun"
 china_ally_japan_desc:0 "If we want to properly challenge the PRC, we will need a lot more strength than we currently do, and our best bet is getting help from Japan. By forming an alliance with them we can better invade the mainland with their superior ships. Only then can we push into the menace's heart."
 china_end_the_PRC:0 "End the communist menace"
 china_end_the_PRC_desc:0 "It is our time to take down the communist regime. Our armies will gather with its allies to invade the mainland and once more unify China under a monarchist banner. We shall succeed where the KMT failed!"
 china_kingdom_reborn:0 "A Restored Kingdom"
 china_kingdom_reborn_desc:0 "With the communists dealing with us ruling China ourselves, we can declare that the Chinese Kingdom has been restored. Fully stabilised, the Kingdom of China under our king shall now be able to defend against any foreign threat, and the Chinese people will live in harmony."
 china_declare_new_qing:0 "A truly Great Qing is born"
 china_declare_new_qing_desc:0 "Our greatest adversary has been cut down. The mandate of heaven lies in our hands, and the Chinese people have finally been liberated. While our chance of retaking the mainland was once unlikely at best, we have proven to the world that our struggle has been successful, and a new imperialist superpower is here to stay."
 china_industrial_effort:0 "The Island Economy"
 china_industrial_effort_desc:0 "Our current geography puts our economy in a situation where we cannot simply copy whatever other capitalist countries have done to improve our economy. We should utilise our geography to our advantage."
 china_economic_stability:0 "Economic Reform"
 china_economic_stability_desc:0 "Our economy may be nothing special compared to other economies, but on the bright side our people generally live good lives, with fewer and fewer suffering on the streets every year. We can't deny that our economy is stabilising."
 china_privatization:0 "Move closer to Laissez-Faire"
 china_privatization_desc:0 "If communism has taught us anything, it would be that mass nationalisation of every industry will lead to disaster. With this knowledge we should do the opposite of communism, for example cut regulations and privatise our companies that we manage too inefficiently."
 china_private_armies:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
 china_private_armies_desc:0 "There are many people in our country who are not in our national army, but are instead in their own private armies. We can hire these private soldiers to make them fight alongside our army, and to keep them willing to help us we will pay them well."
 china_nationalization:0 "Move away from Laissez-Faire"
 china_nationalization_desc:0 "Laissez-Faire is a horrendous approach to the economy that will leave our workers exploited. We must avoid stooping to that kind of approach by regulating the economy more and nationalising more parts of our economy."
 china_increase_corporate_taxes:0 "Tax the Rich"
 china_increase_corporate_taxes_desc:0 "No one in Taiwan should have so much money that everyone else lacks money and cannot afford a better life. We will fix that by increasing our taxes on the rich and using that money to help the poor. We will however receive a lot of backlash for this move."
 china_mine_harder:0 "Expand our Mining Industries"
 china_mine_harder_desc:0 "A strong nation will require many resources, and given that we need to be strong to retake the mainland, we need a lot of resources! To get the resources we need we will expand our mining operations in Taiwan for more valuable metals."
 china_increase_the_local_government_budgets:0 "More funding for local governments"
 china_increase_the_local_government_budgets_desc:0 "Taiwan has many things we need to manage, but that job can be made easier by having local governments do the work of doing things in their area. We should give them more funding so they can better develop the cities while we focus on more important matters with our money."
 china_agrarian_reform:0 "Expand the Agriculture Sector"
 china_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "Food production in Taiwan is in private hands that need to deal with the occasional economic problems, and in the worst case they might not be able to sell their food, causing everyone to suffer. To prevent that we will give our farmers limited subsidies."
 china_increase_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
 china_increase_tourism_desc:0 "No one would deny that Taiwan is a beautiful place, so naturally we earn a lot of money through tourism. However, we can give our economy a much needed boost by promoting Taiwan as a tourist attraction, and more people will come to Taiwan, giving us more money."
 china_get_resources:0 "Mining on the Island"
 china_get_resources_desc:0 "Taiwan is filled with valuable resources. Not only the steel we have, but oil, chromium and tungsten. We must create new mines and search farther for these resources so we can use them."
 china_factories:0 "Factory Reorganisation"
 china_factories_desc:0 "We have quite a few factories here in Taiwan, and their quality is nothing to scoff at, but there are many old and abandoned buildings that can be reorganised into working factories. That should be our next priority."
 china_infrastructure_speed:0 "Road Development Plan"
 china_infrastructure_speed_desc:0 "One company in Taiwan has offered us a deal. Pay them money and they will help with building infrastructure in Taiwan. While expensive, it will be a worthy deal in the long run, so we should accept it and pay them for the help they will grant us."
 china_build_infrastructure:0 "Expand the Island's Infrastructure"
 china_build_infrastructure_desc:0 "We already have existing infrastructure here, which was mostly made by us. But there is room for improvement, mainly in expanding it near the mountains of the east which for any government to connect will be a challenge, but we will not be swayed away. Not without trying first."
 china_sabotage_mainland_infrastructure:0 "The Bomb Road"
 china_sabotage_mainland_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most if not all the value in the mainland comes from the coastal cities. With that in mind we should send some saboteurs to the coastal provinces and have them sabotage the PRC's infrastructure. But this is undoubtedly a risky move and may spark intervention by the government in Beijing."
 china_foreign_investments:0 "Attract Foreign Investors"
