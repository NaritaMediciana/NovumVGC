 usa.1.t:0 "September 11 Attacks"
 usa.1.d:0 "On September 11th, 2001, four planes were abducted by terrorists of the Al-Qaeda network. The hijackers used the commercial airliners American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 93 as flying bombs against the United States. \n\nOn September 11th, 2001, at 8:46 AM, Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade centre in New York City, shortly followed by Flight 175 hitting the South Tower at 9:03 AM. At 9:37 AM, Flight 77 hits the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and at 10:03 AM, Flight 93 crashes after the passengers attempted to take back the plane from the terrorists, causing the plane to not reach its intended target, which likely also was in Washington D.C..\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day. The political situation is completely different from what it was yesterday."

These reports were also confirmed even by five on-duty police officers across the region.\n\nThe aircraft, which made no sound and was reportedly massive in size, operated at treetop level altitude and was spotted several times between 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning.\n\nThe incident has once more funnelled conspiracy theories about secret U.S. Air Force projects or, depending on the conspiracy theorist, an alien invasion or alien control of several world leaders, including the U.S. President [USA.GetLeader]."

 usa.4.d:0 "The massive American computer technology giant Microsoft has steadily expanded ever since its founding in 1975. Microsoft, especially dominant in the home computer markets with its Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98 operating systems, is always looking to broaden its outreach and the amount of computer programs it controls, arguably so that they can no longer be released on non-Microsoft operating systems.\n\nOne such target for expansion is the Seattle-based Visio Corporation, whose acquisition by Microsoft was initially announced in September of 1999. Visio, which is to become the Visio Division within the Microsoft Business Productivity Group, has especially met appraisal for its programs to generate charts, graphs and other data visualisation for corporate administrators, economic experts and product designers. Microsoft, which is paying 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars for the acquisition which is to be finalised on January 7th, 2000, hopes to strengthen its standing with professionals through the annexation of Visio."

 usa.7.d:0 "Today, the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, will have to come to a decision in regards to the fate of young Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez is currently residing in Florida with relatives, after he survived the dangerous escape from Cuba to the United States - an escape during which his mother tragically died. However, the mother tried not only to flee from communism, but also from her husband, Gonzalez' father, who, still back in Cuba, now made demands to have the boy come back to him. \n\nThere can be no doubt from both an American and a Cuban standpoint that it would follow the law to send the young boy back to his father. But there are both moral and political implications here. Should we doom a young man to communistic oppression? Should we jeopardise the Cuban support for the Democratic Party in the vital key state of Florida? \n\nIt all comes down to Reno's verdict now."

 usa.10.d:0 "The death of comic legend Charles M. Schulz on February 12th, 2000, marked the end of a legend and the end of an era. The Minneapolis-born comic artist had drawn the "Peanuts" comic sketches for over 50 years, as well as most of the movie and television scripts of his comic children around Charlie Brown. With more than 17,800 unique comics, "The Peanuts" was the longest-running comic series of all time. One day after the death of its creator, the last original Peanuts comic was published in the Sunday newspapers.\n\nThe death of Schulz leaves comic fans and avid newspaper readers alike in mourning the country over. The comic series will not be continued in accordance with Schulz's wishes - but at 17,800 comics, there is pretty of rerunning that newspapers will be able to do."

 usa.17.d:0 "Tired by the general movement of the American political system towards the right, with Republicans taking increasingly radical and Democrats taking increasingly moderate stances, a new political niche has opened on the far left - a niche that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was happy to fill. The older gentleman of Jewish-Polish descent and long time independent member of the Senate (even though backed by the Democratic Party) is outspoken against American Imperialism and about the dominance of the wealthy over the unfortunate.\n\nIn times like these, populists seem viable. While populists like Donald Trump dominate right-wing rhetoric, left-wing populism is not a great issue in the United States. Will Sanders change that?"

But that is exactly what happened: With several severe and sweeping changes to the rights of states, all American states have been turned into monarchies under authoritarian dukes - and these United Duchies also managed to abolish the Supreme Court, the House of Representatives and the Office of President, uniting all powers in the Senate - which is now controlled by not two senators per state, but by one 'Imperial Legate', handpicked by the respective duke. The United Duchies operate under the concept of 'The Vote of 30', where at least 30 legates have to agree to exercise the otherwise unchecked power of this new self-proclaimed 'Grand Council'."

Those who harbour terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.".\n\nThe Democrats up and down the country have begun rallying around Clinton's statements, signalling not only solidarity with their senator but also with the Republican administration to proceed and to take up any means necessary to find a proper answer to this not only atrocious, but fundamentally anti-American attack."

Not so with Balbir Singh Sodhi.\n\nThe Indian-born Sikh was mistakenly identified as Muslim (because of his middle eastern complexion and his turban) by 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque at Singh's gas station in Mesa, Arizona. Singh was subsequently shot dead by Roque from his truck with a .380 handgun. Roque fled the scene and, twenty minutes later, tried to kill another person, a Lebanon-born store clerk .\nAfter failing at this assassination attempt, Roque ended his terror spree at his own former residence, now taken up by an Afghan family, firing shots at the building but causing no casualties.

Karzai, initially a supporter of the Taliban government, started opposing their increasingly fascistic authoritarianism from 1996 onwards and fled to a United Nations embassy. In Pakistan Quetta, he founded an Anti-Taliban force together with his father and brother in 1997. He funded and armed Northern Alliance forces and sent financial support to Taliban victims and resistance forces within Afghanistan, all the while getting in contact with CIA operatives.\n\nIn 1999, Karzai's father, the Khan of the Pashtun Popalzai people, was assassinated by the Taliban in an attack which Karzai himself, now Khan, barely survived.

The largest group by descent from a single country are, as is custom since decades, the German Americans at about 12.4% of the population.\nThe census did not gather religious data (in accordance with the secular nature of the U.S. as per the First Amendment), however religion did play a role in the so-called "Utah Controversy", when the state of Utah, which failed to gain a fourth congressional seat by a margin of 80 people, tried to have most Mormons outside of Utah count as Utahns in order to gain the seat that now was given to North Carolina. Utah would later take the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in the case "Utah v. Evans", but ended up losing the case.\nThe population continues to age, with age brackets like 45 to 54 growing by 49% and the age bracket of 85 and older growing by 38%.\nWhen it comes to gender, women still outnumber men, especially because they outnumber men two to one in the 85 years and older bracket.\nSexual orientation, in compliance with policies like 'Don't ask, don't tell', was not documented - much to the dismay of gays and lesbians throughout the country."

However, a dominant victory in New Hampshire also gave McCain some prominence.\n\nMcCain ended up unable to use the momentum, winning only 7 contests (his home state Arizona as well as Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts). Keyes did even worse, not winning a single contest. The 43 other states as well as D.C. voted for George Bush, helped by McCain's withdrawal on March 9th.\n\nThe Republicans face a bit of ridicule because of the Bushs becoming a 'Presidential Dynasty' akin to the Democratic Kennedys, but George W.

In response to the military invasion, the Republic of Iraq Radio in Baghdad said that "The evil ones, the enemies of God, the homeland and humanity, have committed the stupid aggression against our homeland and people.". Meanwhile, US military sources have said that five key members of the Iraqi regime, including Saddam Hussein, were targeted in the first attacks."

No one knows whether Hussein and his two sons are alive or dead, but the fall of Baghdad suggests that organised resistance to the invading forces could subside now that the centralised institutions of power in Iraq have been shattered."

For the United States, the military pullout is the fulfilment of a promise to bring troops home from a conflict, widely considered the most unpopular war since Vietnam and one that tainted America’s standing worldwide.

Only George Washington's relentless fight for presidents to pass on power voluntarily - which was eventually made into actual law in form of the 22nd Amendment - made sure that the U.S. would not only have a republican tradition, but furthermore one of presidential term limits.\nNow, monarchism has resurged and the people demand a King of America. Handing the crown back to the English is not an option, so there are essentially three choices: Give the crown to a traditional candidate, to a cultural candidate, or give it to an accomplished candidate.\nOf course, the descendants of George Washington first come to mind when talking about a king. Paul Emory Washington of San Antonio is the first president's closest living descendant and would make a fine figurehead for a royal order of power. But you could also go for a candidate of America's culture, the culture of capitalism. Donald Trump is a businessman who loves money and has a sense of grandeur - specifically what this country needs. He would definitely be a reasonable, respected and uncontroversial leader.

After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again. In his place, the democrats nominated a relatively young environmental activist and former Senator of Tennessee by the name of Al Gore, while the Republicans sent a classical southern Republican, George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency. Democrats demanded a recount, which could not be granted because of Florida voting systems. The Supreme Court is about to overturn the demand for a recount. What should be done?"

In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had.

Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and centre of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populace.
