CPRF devided left forces of Russia into 2 parties, which also influenced the Yeltsin victory in 1993 Moscow events (known in Russia as "Black October").\n\nBy 1995 RCWP has lost much its popular support and CPRF started to become leading Russian left party. Despite American help to Yeltsin regime CPRF won the 1996 elections, but pro-Yeltsin electoral frauds brought victory to previous president. As a parlamentary moderate party CPRF didnt do anything to change the election results.\n\nParty`s programm aims to establish a social state in Russia withput much interruption into business and oligarph spheres.\n\n§!"

It is based on a RCWP (Russian Communist Workers Party) and includes another radical left parties like National Bolsheviks and left wing of CPRF. Front is based on democratic centralism principles and unity of organization. However, parties among the Front secures their specific organization and power structure. This makes UCF something between a united communist party and confederation of different parties.\n\nRussian Communist Workers Party originates from communist opposition to Gorbachev`s policy inside CPSS. Then it was organized as a United Workers Front and a "pros and cons" political club in Leningrad city in late 1980`s. After fall of the Soviet Union RCWP was established. In 1990`s this party was quite influental and could organize rallies with hundreds of thousands participants. However, with time party lost much of people`s support.\n\nDuring the last party congress in 2000 it was decided that workers should have majority in all party departments and majority of decisive votes in all party congresses. This decision can cause a split inside the party as there are party members who dont want to share their power with workers.\n\n§!"
