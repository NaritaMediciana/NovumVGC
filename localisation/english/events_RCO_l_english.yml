  precw.1.t:0 "Coup`d etat"
 precw.1.d:0 "Zyuganov, recently elected president of the country, was removed from power yesterday evening. Unknown people in military uniform entered his Kremlin office and politely asked him to leave the office. After a short conversation, Zyuganov simply left, the soldiers did not even have to use force. A few hours later, the new government appeared on TV, announcing "the prevention of communist slavery and a return to the totalitarian past." Vladimir Putin became the head of the new government. Although support for the Communist Party invariably fell in society due to the half-way reformist course of the party, such an anti-constitutional coup caused a wave of protests. People spontaneously gather in the central squares of cities, speaking in support of Zyuganov. However, it seems that even he himself has no control over protests."
 precw.1.a:0 "Zyuganov removed from power §RPotential Civil War§!"
 precw.1.b:0 "Protests removed Putin's government and returned Zyuganov to power"
 pprecw.1.t:0 "Results of our policy"
 pprecw.1.d:0 "The indecision of the new government and Zyuganov personally in carrying out radical reforms and struggling with Yeltsin`s oligarchy led to the loss of popular confidence and support for the new president`s policy. At the same time, the pro-Yeltsin elements are still strongly opposing the CPRF, no matter what course it will take. The sabotage of the capitalists and the sanctions of the West are hitting the Russian economy very hard, while the starting economic crisis hits most of the Russian people. This of course leads to additional loss of popular support for the CPRF and the president himself."
 pprecw.1.a:0 "We shouldn't try shocking measures on our society"
 precw.2.t:0 "Results of the coup"
 precw.2.d:0 "The protests were unorganised, so they had no effect and were quickly suppressed by the new government. The government announced its provisional character. This time, it is proposed that the fate of Russia will be decided not by the constituent assembly, but by the parliament, in which early elections will be held soon. Situations with economic instability and crisis are getting only worse: foreign investments are leaving Russia, and even Russian oligarchs see no perspective in developing their Russian enterprises and putting money out of the country. In these conditions, the government raises tariffs and taxes on the population. Seems, the entire crisis will be held by the Russian people."
 precw.2.a:0 "Everybody need to tighten their belts"
 precw.3.t:0 "Situation changes"
 precw.3.d:0 "The economic situation in Russia is getting worse, as are the living conditions of the majority of the population. This leads to a wave of crime and spontaneous unorganised protests against the government. Capital is still leaving Russia."
 precw.3.a:0 "Situation is getting worse"
 precw.4.t:0 "United Communist Front"
 precw.4.d:0 "As instability in Russia grows, different communist and some radical left parties in Russia decided to unite in one coalition to organise and lead people's anger against the government. Coalition consists of: RKRP, national bolsheviks, different small left groups and even CPRF takes part in this coalition. On the other hand, reactionary pro-government and far-right elements are also starting to unite across the country as police seems to be able to disobey government in the very critical situation, which can happen in near future."
 precw.4.a:0 "Situation is getting worse"
precw.8.t:0 "Meanwhile in fabrics"
 precw.8.d:0 "Though Russia lost a lot of industry in 1990`s, there are still about 10-15 millions of fabric workers in the country. Their living and working conditions are very bad in comparison with the ones they had in the USSR. With the new crisis they're getting even worse. While there were some events in the 90`s of workers takeover of factories and even workers' militia have sometimes been formed, but nowadays in Russia, with capitalists leaving the country and closing enterprises, acts of workers self-management and takeover of factories are happening across Russia. RKRP has never lost its contacts with workers even after 1992-1993 events, so now they are leading many workers actions and even forming Soviets in some small fabric sites. Government slowly losing power in Russia, while the Soviets are returning to the political stage."
 precw.8.a:0 "History repeats itself"
 precw.5.t:0 "Critical moment is getting closer"
 precw.5.d:0 "People's support for the new communist block rises. Now newly unemployed and wide masses of people with small income groups around the left coalition. However, this coalition seems to be not very united as CPRF talks against Soviets and radical politics of RKRP and nazbols. However, the radical part of the coalition holds a lot of worker congresses and conferences. The most powerful of them for now is the Russian workers committee. Delegates to this meeting are sent from workers collectives from all over Russia, delegates work out united tactics and share workers experience of anti-government actions. This committee is highly influenced by RKRP and now it calls for general strike and congress of Soviets."
 precw.5.a:0 "History repeats itself"
 precw.6.t:0 "First all-Russian Congress of Soviets"
 precw.6.d:0 "General strike has partially collapsed our country. Police cannot even fight criminal elements, right radicals are fighting with communist and workers groups across the country, and the government can hardly be around itself. In this situation communists decided to call for a Congress of Soviets in Petersburg, a heart of revolutionary movement in Russia. In this chaotic situation most delegates will surely arrive in Petersburg and hold the Congress. Perhaps, communists want to repeat bolshevik success and form a new government on the basis of Congress, which will be declared a Supreme power in Russia."
 precw.6.a:0 "Try to deal with it"
 precw.7.t:0 "[GetMonth] congress of UCF"
 precw.7.d:0 "[GetMonth] UCF congress was held, at which the current situation was considered and tasks were set for the near future. The congress was semi-legal. At this congress, M.V. Popov and other prominent figures of the RCWP issued a statement that the time had come to prepare for a socialist revolution. These speeches caused a lot of controversy at the congress. The CPRF split into two factions. The left faction supported the thesis of the RKRP, while the main part of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, together with Zyuganov, opposed it and, having not received the support of the majority of the congress, left it."
 precw.7.a:0 "Significant milestone of the revolution"
precweasy.7.t:0 "New October"
 precweasy.7.d:0 "Police and army groups, which we sent to strike the Congress of Soviets in Petersburg, were demoralised by the people, who crowded around military and police brigades on the way to Obukhov district, where Congress was held. Police and army brigades refused to obey our orders, while squads of right radicals were crushed by armed workers militia, which had been guarding the Congress. Before the Congress began, RKRP together with national bolsheviks had formed the Revolutionary military committee. Communists used workers' militia to capture most important city infrastructure and government buildings. When Congress started, communists announced that from now on all power belongs to the Congress."

 rco_politprosvet.2.d:0 "This morning the constituent congress of the Comintern began. Communist parties of many countries of the world, but not all, were invited to the event. The congress discussed the tactics of the communist parties in the struggle for communism, the attitude of the International towards fascism and social democracy, as well as many other organisational issues. Particularly heated debates were held on the issue of attitudes towards Chinese communism."
 rco_politprosvet.2.a:0 "Interesting"
 rco_politprosvet.3.t:0 "What is Soviet power?"
 rco_politprosvet.3.d:0 "Soviet power is a fundamentally different form of power than the parliamentary system. The new Soviet power in Russia is based on the workplace election principle. Elections take place not by territory, but by production units: plants and factories. The elections themselves and the acquaintance of the workers-voters with the candidates take place at special factory meetings. In the future, the deputy reports on his actions directly to the workers who elected him, at similar factory meetings. This provides the voters with real control over the actions of deputies and a real right of recall.\nLocal Soviets send deputies to form higher-level Soviets. The highest authority is the Congress of Soviets. It approves candidates for ministerial posts and creates a commission that controls the actions of the government.\nInitially, it was planned to create two chambers: the chamber of factory workers and the chamber of clergy. But the revolution made another decision. So far, only the Chamber of Workers is functioning. This creates a solid foundation for the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, a minority of the country's population is now represented in power, although it is the most organised and advanced one."
 rco_politprosvet.3.a:0 "Interesting"
 rco_politprosvet.4.t:0 "Cancel of war communism"
 rco_politprosvet.4.d:0 "The war is over, and we can no longer continue the policy of war communism, that is, the policy of maximum centralization and concentration of resources for the needs of the war. There are several reasons for this.\nFirstly, war communism presupposes the maximum exertion of the forces of the people: working for food, giving up all luxury, and so on. People are no longer able to withstand such harsh living conditions.\nThe second reason is organisational. War communism stops the building of socialist social relations. Working for food means that workers have no incentive to develop production. The factory's management does not care about its profitability, because. their only task is to make a certain amount of products from the raw materials they receive.\nThus, the policy of war communism must be cancelled."
 rco_politprosvet.4.a:0 "Onward, comrades!"
 rco_politprosvet.5.t:0 "Soviet trusts and syndicates"
 rco_politprosvet.5.d:0 "Now we face the task of reestablishing a planned economy in Russia. It is important to avoid the mistakes that led to economic stagnation in the USSR. After analysing the experience of the Soviet era, the party decided to follow the path of the Stalinist Soviet economy. Moreover, one of its foundations, the principle of cost reduction, has already been incorporated into our economy.\nThe system of trusts and syndicates in industry will allow us to combine the initiative of the lower levels and the unity of the economic system in the required proportion. One of the principles of the new Soviet economic model is:0 "Centralization of planning functions, decentralisation of operational functions""
 rco_politprosvet.5.a:0 "Onward, comrades!"
 rco_politprosvet.5.b:0 "Tell me more"
 rco_politprosvet.12.t:0 "How does system of trusts and syndicates work"
 rco_politprosvet.12.d:0 "Trusts and syndicates are formed by branches and territories. That means that all enterprises within the same industry are combined into a trust in a certain territory. Upon merging, enterprises lose their independence and from now on are subordinate to the management of the trust, which creates a single production plan for the entire trust and deploys it for each enterprise. However, each enterprise has its own operational fund, formed from a part of the enterprise's profit, which it uses for its own needs without attracting additional subsidies from the trust. The issues of supplying enterprises and marketing their products are also solved centrally at the level of the entire association. Thus, within the trust, the products of production do not move like goods, narrowing the scope of market laws and replacing them with systematic planning.\nSyndicates are engaged in the sale of enterprises' products in the same way according to the territorial and sectoral principle. The trust sells its products to a trading syndicate, who sells it through a system of state or cooperative stores. If we are talking about goods, which used for production of another products (machine tools, products of the mining industry), then the syndicate interacts with trusts, selling them such products and so supplying them.\nThe system of trusts and syndicates allows us to effectively combine the independence of lower parts of the economy and the unity of its leadership, while replacing the old market relations with new, communist ones."

 rco_politprosvet.6.d:0 "Economic accounting (khozraschyot) is the principle of universal accounting and self-sufficiency of production in a planned economy. This means that from now on, every enterprise should be profitable. This implies the introduction of cost accounting at all levels of production: from brigades to ministries. Of course, universal cost accounting is a matter for the future. But for the time being, we need to convert at least the individual enterprises themselves, as well as all the trusts and syndicates, to self-sufficiency. A system of trusts and syndicates in industry, implying fixed prices and making it possible to plan production, will be a reliable support for the principle of khozraschyot."

 rco_politprosvet.7.t:0 "Udarnichestvo"
 rco_politprosvet.7.d:0 "Udarnichestvo (shock working) is one of the forms of communist labour. Working people, treating their work as "a matter of honour, valour and glory," work for the good of the Motherland, sparing no effort. So far, we are only at the first stage of shock work. Our industry has not yet been re-equipped with new machines, and our workers cannot show their full potential. Now shock work is carried out mainly by overexertion of forces: additional working hours or faster work. But it is an undeniable fact that when our workers take our new  up to-date equipment into their hands, which we will begin to produce in the near future, they will reveal its full potential and will give 200 and 300 percent of output, achieving this not by overstraining forces, but by improving working methods and achieving the highest mastery of new industrial machines."

 rco_politprosvet.8.t:0 "New party program"
 rco_politprosvet.8.d:0 "The political reality of our country has changed dramatically over the past few years, and the time has come to change the program of the RCWP in accordance with the spirit of the times. A question about new party program was submitted to the party congress.\nThe main points of the new program:\n\n1.Soviet Russia is a socialist country that is at the stage of building the first phase of a communist society - socialism.\n\n2.RKRP is the vanguard of the Soviet proletariat. The RKWP is the ruling party in Soviet Russia. The RCWP leads the proletariat and as long as the proletariat itself elects the representatives of the RCWP to the Soviets.\n\n3.The RCWP sees the speedy achievement of the first phase of communism as the first task in the field of state building.\n\n4.The most important tasks on the path of building socialism are: destroying differences between town and country, the destruction of the exploiting classes, the introduction of a universal 6-hour working day, the reduction of inequality.\n\n5.In the sphere of education, it is necessary to make education completely free, and also make polytechnic education universal.\n\n6.In the field of international policy RCWP strives for mutually beneficial cooperation with all progressive forces and countries. At the same time,one of the most important tasks is the integration of the former Soviet republics and the restoration of the USSR within the borders of 1945."
 rco_politprosvet.8.a:0 "Hurrah to the new party program!"
 rco_politprosvet.9.t:0 "Economic program"
 rco_politprosvet.9.d:0 "The economic policy of the communists who came to power in Russia, on the one hand, is an attempt to recreate the Stalinist economic system using modern technologies,and on the other hand, it is a practical implementation of the theoretical researches of a number of late Soviet economists in the field of the so-called. "the law of use value".\nThe Stalinist system of trusts and syndicates in industry has been introduced in Soviet Russia. At the same time, the functions of general planning are assumed by the State Planning Commission.\nThe law of use value actually means that the main indicator by which the efficiency of an enterprise is determined is the indicator of reducing the cost of production, that is, in fact, the reduction in labour costs per unit of output. With the help of this measure, the government of Soviet Russia plans to develop a system of permanent price reduction based on lowering the cost of production, which should strengthen the Soviet currency and contribute to an increase in the living standards of Soviet citizens. At the same time, part of the "saved labour" will be used to reduce the length of the working day. First up to 6, and then up to 4-5 hours a day. This task is considered by the leadership of Soviet Russia to be one of the most important, since by this people will have more time for self-development, self-organisation and other useful activities."
 rco_politprosvet.9.a:0 "Interesting"
 rco_politprosvet.11.t:0 "Communist attitude to labour movement"
 rco_politprosvet.11.d:0 "Recently, the situation in the country has changed a lot. Firstly, the people have seen all the advantages of the Soviet system and are full of enthusiasm in working for the good of our Motherland. Secondly, we have re-equipped our industry with the latest equipment, and now we have great perspectives in further increasing labour productivity with the enthusiasm of the working masses in mastering new industrial equipment.\nBut our people have gone even further. A movement for a communist attitude to labour was born in the advanced labour collectives. It implies not only labour enthusiasm, but also generally exemplary behaviour in everyday and personal life, worthy of a Soviet citizen.\nThe movement for a communist attitude to labour is, without a doubt, a new step that we have reached on the path to building a communist society, which is based on the principle of treating work as a duty."
