Jeju has had an awkward relationship with the Korean Peninsula for hundreds of years, and the impact of this relationship still remains.\n\nJeju has been subject to institutional discrimination since the Joseon Dynasty, The conflict caused by cultural differences and political conflicts between the Korean Peninsula and Jeju became extreme after the dissolution of the Japanese Empire in 1945. Korea's new government regards Jeju as an 'island of communists' and has begun organized genocide against Jeju people. Jeju, where about 200,000 people lived, killed 30,000 people in the 1940s due to the Korean government's genocide.\n\ngenocide in the 1940s, 'April 3 incident' remains in the memory of Jeju people to this day, and has also deeply influenced their political ideology."

 JEJ_gwendang_desc:0 "Gwendang means 'Kindred' in Jeju Language. Gwendang culture is Jeju's special political culture. In Jeju, the concept of 'political party' is meaningless.\n\nJeju residents decide which candidate to elect in the election through their own blood ties and personal connections, along with their rejection of political forces from the mainland korea. due to Gwendang's presence, Jeju politicians choose their own parties regardless of their political ideology. It is acceptable because of Gwendang culture for the right-wing politicians to join a left-wing party or for the left-wing politicians to act in a right-wing party.\n\nDue to Gwendang's influence, Jeju's politics are led by three politicians: Woo Gun-min, Shin Koo-bum and Kim Tae-hwan."
