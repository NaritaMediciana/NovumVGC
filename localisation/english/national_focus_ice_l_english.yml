 ICE_invest_in_the_fishing_industry_desc:0 "The so-called "ocean cluster", which includes all economic sectors related to fishery, is Iceland's most important economic source of income. Just short of 30% of Iceland's entire GDP comes from this ocean cluster. If Iceland is to persist, we need to create jobs and investing in the fishing industry is the right way to do so."
 ICE_make_concessions_to_britain:0 "Make Concessions to Britain"
 ICE_make_concessions_to_britain_desc:0 "Iceland's largest adversary during the Cold War was not the USSR, but the UK. In the "Cod Wars", Icelandic coast guard ships attempted to stop fishing trawlers, mainly British, from overfishing parts of the Atlantic close to Icelandic territory. Iceland extended its 3 nautical miles of exclusive economic area (1952) all the way to 200 nautical miles (1976). Perhaps a few reforms are in order to appease the UK."
 ICE_develop_reykjavik_suburbs:0 "Develop Reykjavik Suburbs"

 ICE_invest_in_the_aluminium_industry_desc:0 "Aluminium goods mark nearly 40% of Icelandic exports, putting the metal even ahead of seafood as Iceland's most popular trade goods on the world market.

 ICE_further_aluminium_investments:0 "Further Aluminium Investments"
 ICE_further_aluminium_investments_desc:0 "Although power-intensive, the aluminium industry has provided Iceland with a stable income. Iceland currently stands at 11th among the world's aluminium producers and we should not allow our potential in this industry to go to waste. Creating further employment opportunities in our aluminium smelting facilities is the logical thing to do."
 ICE_affirm_the_status_quo:0 "Affirm the Status Quo"
 ICE_affirm_the_status_quo_desc:0 "Us Icelanders are a peaceful people. Our island is out of the way, and we don't have any enemies, so what reason do we have to militarise our island? We should go with the flow."
 ICE_bolster_the_coast_guard:0 "Bolster the Coast Guard"

 ICE_defensive_emergency_plans:0 "Defensive Emergency Plans"
 ICE_defensive_emergency_plans_desc:0 "We should also be prepared for an absolute worst case scenario. We wouldn't want to get caught off guard."

 ICE_approach_the_eu:0 "Approach the EU"
 ICE_approach_the_eu_desc:0 "Iceland has been part of the European Economic Area for quite some time. Full European Union membership could hold economic benefits - even though we would lose certain autonomies."
 ICE_maintain_economic_distance:0 "Maintain Economic Distance"

 ICE_create_the_icelandic_air_force_desc:0 "We cannot rely on other nations to police our air for long, we must be self-sufficient."

 ICE_propose_an_alliance_to_sweden_desc:0 "Now that Iceland has chosen NATO to be unworthy, we need to perhaps consider an alliance of smaller scale with other countries that have so far elected to stay neutral. Sweden would be a formidable pick for our next big ally."
 ICE_befriend_russia:0 "Befriend Russia"
 ICE_befriend_russia_desc:0 "Now that we are taking distance from the United States and her allies, we should draw closer to America's adversaries to assure our position in this new world."

 ICE_invite_finland:0 "Invite Finland"
 ICE_invite_finland_desc:0 "Strengthening the Swedish-Icelandic alliance can only be done by involving more formerly neutral states. Finland is a great pick."
 ICE_befriend_china:0 "Befriend China"
 ICE_befriend_china_desc:0 "Far away and following a secret agenda of its own, China is a great and mysterious force to be reckoned with. However, its economic influence is rapidly increasing, and good relations with China might be a finite cake - and we need to get a slice of said cake."

 ICE_icelandic_warship_production_desc:0 "Militarising the coast guard was a good first step in improving our navy, but it is not the last. We need to produce actual warships. We ARE an island, afterall."
 ICE_demand_greenlandic_independence:0 "Demand Greenlandic Independence"
 ICE_demand_greenlandic_independence_desc:0 "The biggest tragedy of the North Sea is that Denmark still maintains sovereignty over Greenland. We need to push them over the edge and force them to allow Greenland to leave."
 ICE_nordic_cooperation_programs:0 "Nordic Cooperation Programs"
 ICE_nordic_cooperation_programs_desc:0 "Iceland is not a major player on the world stage. We have chosen to stay out of faraway conflicts and have instead decided to focus on countries that are close to us both geographically and diplomatically."
 ICE_befriend_norway:0 "Befriend Norway"
 ICE_befriend_norway_desc:0 "Norway ships to us a tenth of Iceland's imports. A conflict with Norway would mean immediate economic backlash and disaster. We need to keep Norway loyal and on friendly terms."
 ICE_befriend_sweden:0 "Befriend Sweden"

 ICE_befriend_france:0 "Befriend France"
 ICE_befriend_france_desc:0 "France is a great potential market that the Icelandic importers and exporters are not yet tapping to the greatest of possibilities. We need to encourage a mutual expansion of markets."
 ICE_befriend_germany:0 "Befriend Germany"
 ICE_befriend_germany_desc:0 "Germany is Iceland's second most important origin of imports and fourth most important destination of exports. The Germans are the perhaps most politically influential force in western and central Europe and have a formidable diplomatic outreach. Having them as Iceland's friend would be a good idea."
 ICE_befriend_the_netherlands:0 "Befriend the Netherlands"
 ICE_befriend_the_netherlands_desc:0 "The Netherlands is far more vital to Iceland than might appear at first glance. Most of Iceland's exports to the European continent have to go through the port of Rotterdam, making the Netherlands Iceland's most important export destination at over a quarter of all exported goods, which puts them well ahead of the UK, Spain, Germany and France, the next most important partners."

 ICE_build_rural_schools:0 "Build Rural Schools"

 ICE_local_power:0 "Local Power"
 ICE_local_power_desc:0 "While we like to think we know what's best for the rural people, we don't have all the answers, so giving slightly more power to local governments should improve the situations there."

 ICE_remembering_history_desc:0 "Only the ignorant will think giving up our freedom to foreigners is worth it. Our history has always been defined by the rejection of foreign authority. We told the monarchy to get out in '44, and we will do so again!"

 ICE_danish_scandinavia_desc:0 "We have full control over Denmark and Norway now. Denmark makes for a valuable ally, so we should let them have the rest of Scandinavia to strengthen them. After all, Sweden never belonged to us."
 ICE_invite_estonia:0 "Invite Estonia"
 ICE_invite_estonia_desc:0 "All of Scandinavia is on our side, from the southern tip of Denmark to the northern tip of Norway.
