 nvv_estonia.1.d:0 "Noblessner Shipyard, established in 1913, originally served as a crucial center for constructing and maintaining submarines under the Russian Empire. Despite enduring the upheavals of both world wars, the shipyard persevered, albeit witnessing numerous changes in ownership and name over time. However, following Estonia's attainment of independence, its operational activities gradually diminished, ultimately leading to Noblessner filing for bankruptcy.\n\nCurrently, the BLTR Group has expressed interest in integrating the shipyard into its corporate portfolio. Nevertheless, there remains an opportunity for independent investment in revitalizing this historic institution."

However, some suggest overlooking the issue, considering Estonia's size and perceived lack of significance. The debate underscores tensions between acknowledging historical legacies and prioritizing diplomatic relations."
