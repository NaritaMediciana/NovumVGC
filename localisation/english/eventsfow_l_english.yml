 israel.1.d:0 "The Israeli retreat from Southern Lebanon, occupied since the Lebanese Civil War of 1982, had been long planned and, according to the United Nations, overdue. While internal support is split, knowing the soldiers home will not hurt the Israeli people."
 israel.1.o1:0 "The boys are home."
 israel.2.t:0 "Negotiations over Golan"
 israel.2.d:0 "The Golan Heights have been occupied by Israeli forces since the Six Days War of 1967. The international community has put repeated pressures on us to at least negotiate over their return to Syria. While acceptance seems unlikely, at least sending a signal might be worthwhile. We should however not forget that Golan is an easily defendable position and heavily fortified. If we decide not to trust the Syrians, keeping the Golan Heights is definitely the way to go."
 israel.2.o1:0 "Offer Syria to negotiate."
 israel.2.o2:0 "Negotiate with Assad? Never!"

 israel.4.o2:0 "A military cooperation should be sufficient."
 israel.5.t:0 "Israel offers alliance for Golan"
 israel.5.d:0 "'If Syria is willing to accept a permanent military alliance with Israel, as well as to recognize it as the rightful owner of its internationally recognized territory, we will retreat from Golan.' \nThe words of the Israeli Prime Minister were followed by a long pause. An alliance is an incredibly unpopular idea in Syria, but the opportunity to recover Golan peacefully and to gain a powerful ally like Israel might be too great to pass up."
 israel.5.o1:0 "A risky move, but indeed what might be necessary."
 israel.5.o2:0 "What?! Death is a preferable alternative to that!"
 israel.6.t:0 "Israel offers military cooperation"
 israel.6.d:0 "The voices in Israel demanding an unobtainable offer were quickly silenced and followed by a quite reasonable offer: Should the Syrian and Israeli forces agree to conduct common manuevres and to establish a constant communications channel, Israel is to retreat from Golan."
 israel.6.o1:0 "Sounds like a bargain!"
 israel.6.o2:0 "How about no?"
 israel.7.t:0 "Israel demands the West Bank"
 israel.7.d:0 "Israel has demanded our remaining land in the West Bank, if we don't comply we risk losing Gaza as well."
 israel.7.o1:0 "For the survival of our people, we must."
 israel.7.o2:0 "We will never succumb to Zionist demands!"
 israel.8.t:0 "Israel demands Gaza Strip"
 israel.8.d:0 "Israel has sent us a demand for the Gaza Strip, hinting aggression if we do not comply. While there would be public outrage, cedeing the region may stop further conflict."

 israel.8.o2:0 "We will never accept the occupation! If this means war, so be it!"
 israel.9.t:0 "Israel issues ultimatum"
 israel.9.d:0 "Israel seems to not be satisfied with just Palestine, and has now threatened our sovereignity using words. They have repeatedly cited a document created in 1919 by the World Zionist orginization claiming part of Jordan into Israeli rule, and they have mobilized a large portion of their armed forces to our border and combat preperations are finished. War seems on the horizon."
 israel.9.o:0 "We will prepare for war."
 israel.10.t:0 "Israel demands Sinai!"
 israel.10.d:0 "Israel has now demanded the Sinai! They say that it is rightful Israeli land, as it was captured in the infamous Six Day War, and was later returned to us in the treaty of the war of 1973. Perhaps giving it to them will spare us of further bloodshed, but we must be careful. The Sinai is a vital buffer zone between our two countries. If we give it up and they decide to go to war with us in the future... They will be able to reach Cario in hours."
 israel.10.o1:0 "We will cede the Sinai."
 israel.10.o2:0 "We will never give in to Israeli demands!"
 israel.12.t:0 "Israel offers Union State"
 israel.12.d:0 "Relations between our two nations have softened, and now the Israelis have offered a union state. If we accept, we will maintain a portion of our sovereignity, but we will mostly be subject to Israeli rule. However, our people will have a voice in the government."
 israel.12.o1:0 "We accept!"
 israel.12.o2:0 "It isn't in our best interests."
 israel.13.t:0 "Israel requests full unification"
 israel.13.d:0 "Israel has now offered a full unification, where they will give all of our citizens Israeli citizenship. Our two nations would form a federation, much like the states in the US. Should we give up our sovereignity to end this conflict?"
 israel.13.o1:0 "Finally, there will be peace! We accept!"
 israel.13.o2:0 "We can't accept that."
 israel.14.t:0 "Israel offers alliance"
 israel.14.d:0 "Israel has offered numerous countries in the Middle East Region seats in a military alliance, and our nation is one of them. If we accept, the Middle East will be a powerful player on the world stage. Should we?"
 israel.14.o1:0 "Why not? Forward to glory!"
 israel.14.o2:0 "Ally with the Zionists!? Never!"
 israel.15.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts alliance proposal!"
 israel.15.d:0 "[From.GetName] has replied to our offer, and accepted!"
 israel.15.o1:0 "For peace in the Middle East!"
 israel.16.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects allinace proposal."
 israel.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] has replied to our offer, and has informed us that an alliance is not in their best interests."
 israel.16.o1:0 "That is a shame."
 israel.18.t:0 "Rioting!"
 israel.18.d:0 "Following our new conscription policy, the Orthodox extremists have came out by the thousands to protest, which quickly escalated into riots. While we managed to restore order, thousands have died and there are reports of Jewish terror cells beginning to attack our industry."
 israel.18.o:0 "They will not break our spirit."
 israel.20.t:0 "Israel offers federation!"
 israel.20.d:0 "Relations between Israel and Jordan have warmed in recent years, and now Israeli officals have come to us offering a federation state, in which Israel and Jordan would become one. What should we do?"
 israel.20.o1:0 "We will be strong together!"
 israel.20.o2:0 "Such a deal is not in our best interests at this moment."
 israel.22.t:0 "The Juersalem Accords"
 israel.22.d:0 "Israel has offered us a compromise where we would be given East Juersalem, parts of Northern Israel, and regions neighboring the Gaza Strip. We have been given the chance to almost completely return to 1947 borders. Do we sign off?"
 israel.22.o1:0 "We would be a fool to reject that!"
 israel.22.o2:0 "Palestine is a friend of Israel. They can keep their land."
 israel.23.t:0 "Rockets launch from Palestine!"
 israel.23.d:0 "Palestine has launched rockets towards our civilian centers in Israel! The damage is still being assessed, in the mean time we need to decide how to respond."
 israel.23.o1:0 "Send them a strongly worded letter."
 israel.23.o2:0 "Launch target strikes at suspected launch sites."
 israel.23.o3:0 "Time to send a message. Commence all out bombardment of suspected sites."
 israel.24.t:0 "Rocket bases destroyed!"
 israel.24.d:0 "Satellite intel shows that the launch sites of the rockets have taken a direct hit with miminal civilian casualties. This is unlikley to draw diplomatic backlash."
 israel.24.o1:0 "Great news!"

 israel.25.d:0 "Satellite intel shows that the launch sites are still operational, and moderate civilain casualties have occured. This may draw diplomatic backlash..."

 israel.26.d:0 "A few days ago Israel suffered rocket attacks from Palestine. Israel retaliated, causing moderate to severe civilian casualties. How should we respond to this?"
 israel.26.o1:0 "We will not support this. Embargo Israel."
 israel.26.o2:0 "Show Israel we do not approve, but wish to maintain economic ties."

 news_ISR.1.d:0 "Recent efforts by the United Nations to make Israel reconsider its occupation of the Golan Heights, ongoing since 1967, have been thwarted by the Israeli government, even after this very government had sent positive signals by retreating from South Lebanon at the end of May. The prime minister of Israel called Syria 'a dishonest safe heaven for terrorism and viciousness' and a 'fundamental and never-ending threat to Israeli independence'. It is unlikely that these two nations will work out their differences any time soon."

Paul Emory Washington of San Antonio is the first president's closest living descendant and would make a fine figurehead for a royal order of power.

Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency.

The Republican Party had to readjust after the gamble to mix radical and moderate Republicans had failed with the McCain-Palin ticket of 2008.\n\nThe Republicans went through a primary process with many voters from many parts of the Republican Party, from strict christians like Rick Santorum to Rick Perry to libertarian approaches like the one of Ron Paul. The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."

 election_USA.5.t:0 "Election of 2016"
 election_USA.5.d1:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 might have been one of the most heated and ideologically charged political showdowns of the 21st Century. The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"
 election_USA.5.d2:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has become a battle of two wings of populism.\n\nAfter the Democratic Nomination had been a close race that once more ended up seeing Hillary Clinton as the loser, as before in 2008; the Republican race quickly had become dominated by a far-right rhetoric battle between Donald Trump and similar-minded contestants like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nNow, both candidates promise to battle Wall Street influences and to give back America to the people. Who will it be? The independent senator, legend among left-wing progressives, from small Vermont, Bernie Sanders; or the successful and famous businessman from New York City, Donald Trump?"
 election_USA.5.d3:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been described as the 'battle of the sleeper agents' by a far-left online commentator. Both Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, the two major candidates, are hugely unpopular and are booed by wings of their own party for their uncharismatic behavior. Both the \"Sanders Progressives\" and the \"Trump Nationalists\" hate their party's candidate and are looking into alternatives, like the Greens, the Libertarians and the Constitutionalists. Who will it be among the 'sleeper agents' then? Cruz or Clinton?"
 election_USA.5.d4:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a lopsided affair, comparable to the Reagan, Nixon and Roosevelt landslides. Where the Democrats managed to bring a hugely popular progressive candidate, Bernie Sanders, into the mix; the Republicans failed to nominate a unifying candidate and went with Ted Cruz - a man that was described with flattering words like 'vindictive', 'straight-up evil' or 'the anti christ' even among fellow conservatives for his behavior of flip-flopping.\n\nThe polls are clear, Sanders is favored by a near 10% edge - but the electoral college is known to be a mischievous mistress. Can Cruz win?"
 election_USA.5.d5:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been titled 'battle of sociopaths' by left-wing TV host Bill Maher. Indeed it seems that both Republican candidate Marco Rubio and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are unpopular, uncharismatic and pragmatic - but no one doubts that both of them have a certain talent as politicians.\n\nSo, which uninspiring, uncharismatic sociopath will it be? Marco Rubio from Florida or Hillary Clinton from New York?"
 election_USA.5.d6:0 "'I have never witnessed such a weak political performance, and that is saying something', neo-nazi leader Richard Spencer wrote about the first debate of the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nIndeed, there is not much to be had for far-right voters when looking at the battle of two moderates, comparable to the 1992 election between Clinton and Bush Sr.\n\nThis time, Democratic candidate for nomination Clinton - but the female one - failed to overcome a far-left challenger in the form of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders and Rubio, apart from the far right criticism, have both been praised by the media for their respective campaigns that very much focussed on issues rather than mudslinging. 'If this holds up, we might actually restore a political discourse', Bill O'Reilly commented on the election race.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
 election_USA.5.d7:0 "'Kasich versus Clinton. If that sounds boring, wait until you see it.', TV show host Bill Maher snarked at the candidates the two major political parties chose.\n\nThe US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a shock to both far left and far right voters. Both campaigns have super moderate candidates, both campaigns have largely abstained from mudslinging moves, both campaigns have been described as being lead by 'corrupt kleptocrats' by an MSNBC commentator.\n\nThat sounds demotivating, but one these needs to be president. So let's go for it! Who will it be? Clinton or Kasich?"
 election_USA.5.d8:0 "'This had to have been the most left-wing campaigns I ever saw in my life, it's horrible', Ann Coulter complained on Fox News about the second Presidential Debate of the 2016 US Election.\n\nA far left Democrat, Bernie Sanders, meets a very moderate fiscal Republican, John Kasich, in the arena of the longest and most expensive election of not only American but also world history.\n\nSanders slashed Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for his stance on Planned Parenthood and his cowardly mannerisms when dealing with big business, while Kasich called Vermont senator Sanders out for the very extended gun rights in his home state, thus making Sanders' gun control platform one of hipocrisy.\n\n'This campaign has been highly productive and interesting', a British foreign policy observer commented on the BBC. The global and internal interest is now reaching its peak on election day. Who will win?"

 usa.71.d:0 "Both the White House and the Senate have now voted to authorize military action against Iraq. The joint resolution was approved by the House last evening and the Senate followed suit early this morning. The congressional vote endorsing the resolution on Iraq is seen as a solid endorsement that the President will work with the United Nations if possible, or alone, if nessecary, to dissarm Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction."

 usa.72.t:0 "The Invasion of Iraq"
 usa.72.d:0 "The United States offered intelligence to the Security Council suggesting that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. While no evidence has been found yet, there is still suspicion of the Saddam possessing them. It's been well documented that Hussein used chemical weapons in the past, including attacks against civilians. Given Hussein's reputation of supporting terrorists as well as possibile links to Al-Qaeda, plans have been drawn up for an invasion of Iraq. The plan is to first end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate, and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to capture and drive terrorists out of the country as well as secure the Iraqi oilfields. Fourth, to collect as much intelligence as we can to relate to terrorist networks and the global network of illicit WMDs. And last, to help the Iraqi people to create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government while providing humanitarian support to the displaced and many needy Iraqi citizens."

 usa_news.19.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] delivered a live address shortly after explosions rocked the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, signalling the launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The U.S.-led campaign aims at ridding Iraq of its dictator, Saddam Hussein, and eliminating its ability to store, develop, and deploy its stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. The strike comes just days after Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein defied a 48-hour deadline to leave the country. In response to the millitary invasion, the Republic of Iraq Radio in Baghdad said that "The evil ones, the enemies of God, the homeland and humanity, have committed the stupid aggression against our homeland and people.". Meanwhile, US military sources have said that five key members of the Iraqi regime, including Saddam Hussein, were targeted in the first attacks."

 usa_news.20.d:0 "U.S. tanks drove unhindered into public squares as downtown Baghdad slipped from the grip of the Ba'ath regime. The scene in central Baghdad, where Iraqi citizens and American marines collaberated in toppling a huge statue of Saddam Hussein, signaled that a complete American military victory in Iraq may be achieved within a matter of days, not months, although there may still be some difficult combat ahead in outlying Baghdad neighborhoods and areas north of the capital, including Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. No one knows whether Hussein and his two sons are alive or dead, but the fall of Baghdad suggests that organized resistance to the invading forces could subside now that the centralized institutions of power in Iraq have been shattered."

The arrest comes within months after U.S. troops swept into the Iraqi capital, and brings an end to one of the most intensive manhunts in history. In a televised address this afternoon, the U.S. President, [USA.GetLeader] said that Saddam will face "the justice he denied to millions". He said that the former Iraqi leader's arrest "marks the end of the road for him and all who bullied and killed in his name".

The sentence was carried out at a former millitary intelligence headquarters in a Shia district of Baghdad at 6:00am local time (3:00am GMT). In a prepared statement, [USA.GetLeader] cautioned that Saddam's execution would not stop the violence in Iraq, but said it was "an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain, and defend itself, and be an ally in the war on terror". The office of the Iraqi Prime Minister, released a statement that said Saddam's execution was a "strong lesson" to ruthless leaders who commit crimes against their own people."

 usa_news.23.d:0 "The last convoy of U.S. soldiers pulled out of Iraq, ending nearly nine years of war that inflicted many casualties on both sides, and left a country grappling with political uncertainty. The final column of around 100 mostly U.S. military MRAP armoured vehicles carrying 500 U.S. troops trundled across the southern Iraq desert from their last base through the night and daybreak along an empty highway to the Kuwaiti border. For the United States, the military pullout is the fulfilment of a promise to bring troops home from a conflict, widely considered the most unpopular war since Vietnam and one that tainted America’s standing worldwide. For Iraqis, though, the departure brings a sense of sovereignty tempered by nagging fears their country may slide once again into the kind of sectarian violence that killed many thousands of people at its peak in 2006-2007."
