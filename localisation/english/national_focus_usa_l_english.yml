USA_create_jobs_on_the_east_coast_desc:0 "The Atlantic Seaboard sports a number of large cities, from New York to Boston to Baltimore as well as several of the Southern states. A regulatory overhaul could go a long way toward incentivizing new industrial investments in the region."

USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south:0 "Encourage Growth in the American South"
USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south_desc:0 "The South was never the most financially successful part of the United States, but by the late 20th century, their service sector, manufacturing base and energy industry seemed to grow almost exponentially.

USA_civilian_industry_rocky_mountains:0 "Civilian Industry: Rocky Mountains"
USA_civilian_industry_rocky_mountains_desc:0 "To an outsider, the Rocky Mountains may seem like an odd place for an industrial hub. We may need to financially support a few pioneers in order to really get the ball rolling."
