### Desc:0 ""
ISR_diplomatic_focus_desc:0 "Israel is surrounded by hostile neighbours across its borders. We must work to fix this, either through diplomacy, or through more... aggressive means." 

ISR_aggressiveFocus_focus_desc:0 "We will never be able to have peace with our neighbours! We must focus on being aggressive, and making our enemies fear us so they will not attack. The best defence is a good offence!"
ISR_westBankClaim_focus_desc:0 "The West Bank was supposed to be our land, but was annexed by our enemies long ago, then released as the Palestinian state. It is so close to Jerusalem it MUST be reclaimed."  
ISR_gazaClaim_focus_desc:0 "Gaza is rightful Israeli land! They will never be peaceful with us, firing missiles at us and killing innocent civilians, we must find peace through force."  
ISR_JordanClaim_focus_desc:0 "According to a document drafted by the World Zionist Organization in 1917, Jordan should be part of Israel as well. We have fought with them in the past, it will never be any different. We must ensure that they will not be a threat ever again."  
ISR_SinaiClaim_focus_desc:0 "The Sinai Peninsula is a strategically important chokepoint. It was captured by us following a defensive war, and having our troops only a hundred miles away from Cairo will make the Egyptians think twice!"  
ISR_greater_ISR_focus_desc:0 "We will never be safe as long as enemies surround us. We were promised almost the entirety of the Middle East by G-d, and it is time to take it."  

ISR_peacefulCoexistence_focus_desc:0 "We will never find internal or external peace via conquest. We must improve relations with our Middle Eastern brothers if we are to survive."

ISR_two_state_solution_desc:0 "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has raged for too long and killed too many. It is time to work for peace through a two-state solution."
ISR_respect_PAL_Sov_focus_desc:0 "If Israel and Palestine do not respect each other's right to exist, they will both fall. It is time to respect their sovereignty."

ISR_allow_right_of_return_desc:0 "Many Palestinians fled their homes after the founding of Israel, and are now refugees. We should allow them to return."
ISR_1947_borders_desc:0 "Allowing every Palestinian to return to their homes in Israel would shift demographics too much. It would be much more realistic to instead draw up a set of land compromises that are based on the 1947 original partition plan. We will call this plan the Jerusalem Accords."

ISR_one_state_solution_desc:0 "A two-state solution is not a viable end to the conflict. We are stronger together."
ISR_offer_union_state_desc:0 "We should offer Palestine a union state, where our nations would remain separate, but would have a say in each other's policies."
ISR_offer_unification_desc:0 "It is time to offer the Palestinians to peacefully integrate into Israel. Perhaps this time they will accept due to the warming of relations in recent years. United we conquer, divided we fall!"

ISR_middle_east_alliance_desc:0 "Relations with nations of the Middle East have improved substantially over the last couple of years. It is time to offer them an alliance. Perhaps there can be peace in the Middle East!"
ISR_offer_Jordan_federation_desc:0 "Jordan is the most similar nation to Israel in the Middle East. Perhaps we can put aside our differences and unite together as one large nation, one to be feared and respected throughout the world."

### Desc:0 ""
ISR_domestic_focus_focus_desc:0 "We have some pressing issues internally that we must deal with before looking outward. Let's focus on that."  

ISR_internal_policy_focus_desc:0 "We have pressing decisions to make at home, namely problems revolving around the settlements and the Ultra-Orthodox community. Let's get started."  

ISR_the_settlements_desc:0 "Manpower is Israel's most coveted resource by far. We must work to establish settlements that will hopefully one day lead to cities throughout our nation."
ISR_integrate_negev_desc:0 "The Golan Heights have been part of Israel ever since they were captured in 1967, they are as much a part of Israel as anywhere else now, the international community must respect this."
ISR_westBank_Settlements_desc:0 "Settlements in the West Bank would provide a vital manpower base near a vital area. It may also improve Palestine's population. We should work to establish some."
ISR_Gaza_Settlements_desc:0 "Settlements in and around Gaza would put people near the contested region, which should tell the world that we are here to stay."
ISR_Enlarge_WestBank_Settlements_desc:0 "Now that a functional community has been established near the West Bank, let’s work to expand it, making it into a fully-fledged city."
ISR_Enlarge_Gaza_Settlements_desc:0 "We should enlarge the Gaza settlements into a fully-fledged city, which should give surrounding nations a pause before invading."

ISR_defend_settlements_desc:0 "Now that cities have been established near contested regions, we need to work to defend them. If we do not, thousands could die."
ISR_encourage_settlement_migration_desc:0 "Let's encourage our people to move to these new settlements, which will bring our population up and increase the industry there."

ISR_the_orthodox_jews_desc:0 "The Ultra-Orthodox Jews have been causing a headache for Israel since its founding. If we oppose them, we may cause civil unrest, but become a much more mobilised society. But perhaps there may be an upside for supporting them..."  

ISR_fight_the_orthodox_desc:0 "The extreme Orthodox have weakened our manpower pools and economy for too long! We should work to make sure that they are required to work just like any Israeli."
ISR_remove_compensations_orthodox_desc:0 "Currently, the Israeli government gives out handouts to those who study Jewish scripture for a living. This needs to stop if we are to maximise our full economic potential."
ISR_universal_conscription_desc:0 "A portion of fighting-age Israelis are of the Ultra-Orthodox community, so they are exempt from conscription laws! This needs to end. Everyone must fight to defend our homeland, there should be no exceptions."
ISR_secular_society_desc:0 "We can be a Jewish state without having religion seep into government policies. We should work to completely separate church and state once and for all."

ISR_support_the_orthodox_desc:0 "As a Jewish State, we should work to promote hyper-religious ideologies, and begin to give the Rabbinate more power."  
ISR_encourage_talmund_study_desc:0 "By encouraging Talmud studying and giving compensations to those who devote their life to Jewish scripture, society will become much more unified."  
ISR_impliment_jewish_law_desc:0 "We as a nation are becoming more and more a Jewish religious state. We should further this example by implementing official Halakha law."  
ISR_prepare_for_the_messiah_desc:0 "All of the signs of the second coming of the Messiah are apparent! Conflict has begun to rage across the world, and we as a nation must be ready to welcome our saviour! We need to reinstate the Israeli monarchy to fulfil the prophecy. The end times are near!"

### Political Focus [Desc:0 ""]
ISR_political_focus_focus_desc:0 "We must decide which way our nation will go. Will we become a haven for democracy... Or will we take a more... Authoritarian view?"  

ISR_support_the_left_desc:0 "Progress is the only way forward! Israel must be the harbinger of new, radical ideas!"  
ISR_support_far_left_desc:0 "Capitalism is not the way forward. If we as a nation are to survive, we must promote Marxist ideals for the good of the collective, not for the individual."  

ISR_support_center_left_desc:0 "Marxism has been shown to only lead to the fall of democracy. We should not go that far. We should instead focus on promoting scientific innovations and individualism."  
ISR_scientific_utopia_desc:0 "Since the founding of our nation, we have been known for our innovation. By devoting substantial funds to research and development, we will be able to protect ourselves more effectively, as well as make the holy land into a utopia for all." 

ISR_support_the_right_desc:0 "Our nation has fallen out of touch with its founding ideals. We must look to our nation before others."  
ISR_red_israel_desc:0 "The Revolution has purged the old government out of power. It is time to make our nation a new haven for Marxist ideas. For the Motherland!"  

ISR_islamic_thought_desc:0 "A large percentage of Israelis are Muslim. We should work to appease them politically."  
ISR_sharia_law_desc:0 "We must implement Sharia law to show our dedication to Allah. We are no longer a Jewish state, but an Islamic one!"  

ISR_conservative_thought_desc:0 "We need to get back to our roots as a nation. Too much progress too quickly inevitably causes problems for countries."  
ISR_realpolitik_desc:0 "We need to make only rational and logical policies if we are to survive as a nation."  

ISR_nationalist_thought_desc:0 "We are a Jewish State. If we do not promote feelings of pride and nationalism in our nation, we will fall."  
ISR_jew_state_desc:0 "We began as a Jewish State, and we will always be one. We must rally the people behind the Israeli flag and instill strong feelings of patriotism and nationalism. For the Fatherland!"
