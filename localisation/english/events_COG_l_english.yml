 congo.1.t:0 "Laurent Kabila's Child Soldiers"
 congo.1.d:0 "President Laurent-Désiré Kabila relies on a large body of child-soldier bodyguards, know as Kadogos,for his personal protection, with the DRC employing upwards of 10000 conscripted minors, comprising a significant percentage of our militias. This is being increasingly condemned by the international community, and, while one of the alleged main reasons to recruit child soldiers is their supposed loyalkty, many in government, including Kabila himself, are starting to suspect that the kadogos are involved insome kind of conspiracy against the president.\n So the question of the child soldiers remain\: Should the kadogos be dismissed or are they still necessary for the war effort against Uganda and Rwanda?"
 congo.1.a:0 "They are still needed"
 congo.1.b:0 "This has gone too far, dismiss them"

 congo.2.d:0 "Laurent-Désiré Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was assassinated in his office inside his official residence at the Palais de Marbre, Kinshasa. The assassin was an 18-year-old boy soldier, a kadogo, and there are strong indications that the murder was the result of a conspiracy by the kadogos. Laurent's son, Joseph Kabila succeeded his father to the presidency at the young age of 29."

 congo.3.t:0 "An opportunity for peace"
 congo.3.d:0 "The death of Kabila, tragic as it was, created an opportunity for an end to this bloody war. The Rwandan and Ugandan militaries shall leave Congolese territory, the rebel groups they support shall disarm and join a Transitional Government until free democratic elections are held. Our government will also try to dismantle the Interahamwe and other hutu-supremacist militias operating in our territory."

 congo.4.t:0 "The DRC offers peace"
 congo.4.d:0 "The death of Laurent Kabila means that calmer heads are now leading the DRC. They've approached our government with a proposal for peace\: our forces shall leave Congolese territory, the rebel groups we support shall disarm and join a Transitional Government until free democratic elections are held. The DRC also promised to try to dismantle the Interahamwe and other hutu-supremacist militias operating in our territory."

 congo.4.b:0 "We will fight on!"

 congo.5.d:0 "After the defeat against Rwandan and RCD-Goma forces in the recent skirmishes, internal revolt and instability rocked the RCD-Kinsangani leadership. Professor Wamba Dia Wamba, after seeing his position collapse and surviving multiple assassination attempts, was ousted by Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi, who renamed the movment as \"Rally for Congolese Democracy - Kisangani - Movement for Liberation\". Wamba fled the capital and found a splinter faction with his supporters, but he's become militarily irrelevant."

 congo.7.t:0 "The War of Congolese Unification"
 congo.7.d:0 "Kabila's regime in Kinshasa is no more. We achieved victory in the struggle against the Congolese dictator, but the war is far from over, as multiple rebel factions now control different parts of the country, and only one will achieve supremacy over the rest and be recognized as the rightful sucessor to the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
 congo.7.a:0 "Forwards!"

 congo.12.a:0 "Finally"
 congo.13.t:0 "The Kivu Conflict"
 congo.13.d:0 "The peace process of the Second Congo war isn't going smoothly. As enemy rebel forces disarm and DRC forces move into the Kivu region in Eastern Congo in order to crush the radical Hutu FDLR militias, former RCD military commanders, chief among them Laurent Nkunda, refused to accept the peace terms and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), launching an insurgency in the region, probably with assistance from their former benefactors, the Rwandans."
 congo.13.a:0 "In the Grim Darkness of the Congo Basin there's Only War"
 congo.14.t:0 "The Kivu Conflict"
 congo.14.d:0 "Our victory in the Second Congo War didn't mean the end of hostilities in the Congo. Cornered, the radical hutu militias of the FDLR, remnants of the Interahamwe responsible for the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, have rose up against us and our puppet regime in the Kinshasa."

 congo.15.d:0 "Previously dormant land disputes between two ethnic groups in the Ituri region, the Hema and Lendu, have flared up once again after the instability of the recent leadership change in the RCD/K-ML. While conflict was previously seen in the region in 1999, it had temporarily ceased, but the peace is now broken, and bloodshed returns."
 congo.15.a:0 "This is getting ugly"
 congo.16.t:0 "Flag Change"
 congo.16.d:0 "A minor change was proposed to the national flag. A blue field with a small yellow star, situated in the top corner of the hoist side, with a red, yellow-lined band running diagonally across the center. While the blue field with a yellow star is a symbol of the Congo since the days of Leopold II, this flag was resignified so that the red symbolized the people's blood; the yellow symbolized prosperity; the blue symbolized hope; and the star represented unity. A design very similar to the proposed one was used after the Congo Crisis, from roughly 1993 to 1971, when Mobutu renamed the country Zaire"
 congo.16.a:0 "Let's adopt it!"
 congo_news.1.t:0 "The end of the Great Congo War"
 congo_news.1.d:0 "After years of brutal conflict, it appears that the Second Congo War, a conflict that has been called \"The African World War\", has finally ended. \nThe murder of Congolese dictator Laurent-Désiré Kabila apparently opened the way for negotiations, mediated by South Africa, in which Rwanda and Uganda agreed to remove their forces from the DRC, and the rebel forces they supported agreed to surrender their weapons and start operating as legal political parties in a new Transitional Government. \nWhile it remains to be seen how successful the attempts to disarm the various militias that where proped up during the conflict will be, there's no denying that a dark chapter of African history has come to a close."

 congo_news.2.d:0 "After years of brutal conflict, it appears that the Second Congo War, a conflict that has been called \"The African World War\", has finally ended. \nForces loyal to [COG.GetLeader] drove the invading Ugandan and Rwandan armies back to the border and crushed the rebel gruops they supported. \nWhile it remains to be seen if [COG.GetLeader] truly rules unnoposed as master of the Congo, or if the remnants of armed groups proped up during the war will be the cause of future trouble, there's no denying that a dark chapter of African history has come to a close, for better or worse."
 congo_news.3.d:0 "After years of brutal conflict, it appears that the Second Congo War, a conflict that has been called \"The African World War\", has finally ended. \nSoldiers of the Rwanda Defence Force march proudly trough Kinshasa, and [RCD.GetLeader] has been inagurated president of the DRC, in a regime that will no doubt act favorably to their Rwandan sponsors. \nStill, it remains to be seen if this new order will last and [RWA.GetLeader] will truly rule unnoposed as master of the Congo, or if the remnants of armed groups proped up during the war will be the cause of future trouble. Either way there's no denying that a dark chapter of African history has come to a close, for better or worse."
 congo_news.4.d:0 "After years of brutal conflict, it appears that the Second Congo War, a conflict that has been called \"The African World War\", has finally ended. \nSoldiers of the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces march proudly trough Kinshasa, and a new regime, filled with members of rebel groups sponsored by the Ugandans, has been installed. \nStill, it remains to be seen if this new order will last and Uganda will truly be consolidated as a regional power in Central Africa, or if the remnants of armed groups proped up during the war will be the cause of future trouble. Either way there's no denying that a dark chapter of African history has come to a close, for better or worse."

 congo_news.5.d:0 "The peace process in the Congo isn't going smoothly. As troops of Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo moved to the Kivu region in the Eastern part of the country, they faced resistance from both the hutu-extremist \"Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda\" (FDLR) and the tutsi-dominated \"National Congress for the Defence of the People\", led by warlord Laurent Nkunda, who's allegedly being supported by the Rwandan government."
