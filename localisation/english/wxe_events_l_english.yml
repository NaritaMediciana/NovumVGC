The new old government will have to pay debts to foreign powers and their mercenaries for a long time for their help in defeating the communists, without which, probably, the victory over the Soviets would have been impossible. The federal government also has to centralize the country, which during the war turned into some kind of warlord-era China. Apparently, this conflict was profitable only for foreign states, which turned Russia into their semi-colony with a system of enslaving treaties."
