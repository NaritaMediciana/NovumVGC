 AST_jet_multirole_equipment_6_desc:0 "In 2014 Australia considered procuring the F-35B, a VTOL variant, for their Canberra-Class helicopterdock ships. The immense delays and issues of the F-35 program led this to be a discarded idea. With the program now finally coming to maturity, and the global improvements of the F-35's capability, the F-35B is looking to be a very capable fighter. With the procurement of the B-model comes the latest in material upgrades as well, including advanced flight computer and targetting capabilities."

 AST_jet_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "F-111C (nicknamed "Pig") is a variant of the F-111 Aardvark medium-range interdictor and tactical strike aircraft, developed by General Dynamics to meet Australian requirements. The design was based on the F-111A model but included longer wings and strengthened undercarriage. The Australian government ordered 24 F-111Cs to equip the RAAF in 1963, but the aircraft were not delivered until 1973 because of long-running technical problems."

 AST_jet_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The FB-111 was a USAF variant of the F-111 with strengthened wings, stronger landing gear, larger fuel capacity and increased bomb load with the intent of making it a strategic bomber. With the introduction of the B-1B Lancer, the USAF had no need for the FB-111, and it was reconfigured back into a tactical role and renamed the F-111G. In 1993 the RAAF purchased 15 of these aircraft to supplement their F-111Cs."

 AST_jet_bomber_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit is an American heavy penetration strategic bomber, featuring low observable stealth technology designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defenses; it is a flying wing design with a crew of two. With the introduction of the B-21 in the US arsenal, Australia was able to procure older B-2s to fill the long-held gap of strategic bombers. While RAAF doctrine has had little use for strategic-level attacks, the allure of an aircraft with still-viable stealth technology was too valuable to pass up."

 AST_jet_bomber_equipment_5_short:0 "B-21"
 AST_jet_bomber_equipment_5_desc:0 "The B-21 is a long-range, air-refuelable, highly survivable aircraft with significant nuclear and conventional stand-off and direct-attack weapons payload. The LRS-B provides operational flexibility across a wide range of military operations. Acquired in the 2030s after intense negoatiations, this upgrade over the previous B-2 design is a very big leap in strategic-level destruction."
